It's the first time since before Prohibition the Jack Daniel Distillery has used a new grain recipe. Rye has always been part of the Jack Daniel’s Old No. 7 grain bill but it has never been the lead grain until now. When our tasters sampled it after distillation, they said this should not wait to be released. Jack Daniel’s Unaged TN Rye is offered only in a small batch and in limited supply so the majority of the new rye whiskey can mature in Jack Daniel’s barrelhouses for future release.     

Although this unaged rye is not a mature whiskey, it offers a spicy, surprisingly sweet flavor. Whiskey enthusiasts  and those who aspire to be “master tasters” are sure to appreciate its raw nature. It’s a chance to taste the unaged spirit as our master tasters do, appreciating what the grain adds to the whiskey before the spirit draws its flavor from the barrel."

From Tokyo to London to Louisville, Jim Beam sets the benchmark for what a bourbon should be, aged twice as long as required by law for a flavor that's unlike any other. Distilled with corn, malted barley, time, pride and passion, there's a reason why Jim Beam Bourbon is on almost every bar shelf. However, it isn't the name that should entice you. Opening a bottle is the best way to celebrate life events, gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. It's as versatile as it is smooth, something you've probably always aspired to be, yet it does so effortlessly.

To get the distinct flavor of Jim Beam Bourbon, the distillery ages the liquor in charred oak barrels for a minimum of four years. This imparts a medium body and a caramel color that you've come to know in a bourbon. The oaky, vanilla and spicy backdrop greets you with a swirling of the bourbon, inviting you to taste what lies within the glass. When you finally raise the glass, your taste buds become overwhelmed with a five-pronged attack of sweetness, grain, oak, char and fruit. Most five-pronged attacks are best left to the battlefield or sporting event, but this bludgeons you over the head with flavors that keep you coming back. Enjoy Jim Beam Bourbon on the rocks, with a splash of water or in one of your favorite cocktails.

In days gone by, every bar had its own creation of rock and rye.    During the late 1800's several rock candy companies existed, including one formed in 1880 by Charles Dryden and Noah Palmer.

Appearance: Rose gold with highlights of worn copper.

Nose: Opens with mature aromas both sweet (canelé, panna cotta, crème de noyaux) and savory (walnut oil, leather). This is followed quickly by a vast array of fruit derived both from the spirit (smoked apricot, grapefruit peel) as well as the cask treatment (sloe gin, damson jam). The aroma is high toned, pungently floral and herbaceous, with subtle, balancing pops of minerality.

Palate: Darker (cocoa, molasses, burnt marshmallow) and spicier (cola, nutmeg, Tellicherry peppercorn) than the nose, an effect well-complemented by the cask treatment and rendered more complex by the savory and herbaceous themes running throughout.

Finish: A sweet and elegant signature of rose jelly, chestnut honey, and Pineau des Charantes that also features hazelnut, eucalyptus, and Corsican mint."

It is a perfect union of grain and barrel, with an old, oaky nose and a deep, honey- maple palate that reveals the lushness of the grain.

Appearance: Worn leather

Nose: Incredibly fruity, the nose opens with strawberry salt-water taffy, Bing cherry, and raspberry but more exotic fruits lurk in the depths: prickly pear, lychee, blood orange, grapefruit marmalade, damson plum, even tomato. The fruits nearly overpower subtle herbaceous notes of pizzelle, Maraschino liqueur, Cynar, and pipe tobacco. Its sweetness is kept in check by a hint of paraffin and scorched earth.

The palate is as fruity as the nose, exhibiting strawberry and rose jam, lychee, Maraschino liqueur, and calvados, balanced by très leches cake, hibiscus, and angelica.

The finish slowly evolves into more fruit: guava, watermelon, Pink Lady apples; they’re joined by a touch of paraffin from the nose and a spicy signature of candied chili pepper."

Imagine a brioche French toast dripping with fresh-churned butter and dark maple syrup. With each bite, a spiciness reminiscent of fine, stone ground chocolate lingers in the back of the mouth. Soft to the palate throughout, the next sip is always welcome. The mash is a mix of corn, rye, and malted barley. Akin to a “Vatted Malt,” no neutral grain spirit is added. We do not chill filter, a common practice that removes natural, flavor rich oils. Only a coarse particulate filter strains the small bits of charred oak surrendered by the barrel. Like many great whiskeys, this spirit has aged gently in ex-bourbon barrels. As much as we love the intense flavor of a bourbons, the abundant wood sugars in the new barrels required for their production mask many subtler, complex flavors. This spirit’s patient aging in used cooperage yields a drier dram open to revealing these subtle essences of taste."

A portrait of finely tuned blending, Batch 025 is citrusy and peppery, without losing the opulence and oaky ease of the older ingredients.

The nose is focused, resembling a great hot toddy -- honey, orange zest and clove. Ripe banana emerges, joined by a little resinous rosemary and jasmine. The palate gets much thicker as gooey caramel takes center stage. It gets more floral as well, tasting of orris root and potpourri. The finish becomes rather delicate, with coffee ice cream being joined by dried fig and chamomile."

The ripe, floral pear notes provide a soft entrance into a whiskey that is adorned with hints of spice and arid citrus derived from the Amaro casks (and also the toasty bourbon itself). This mélange of flavor is framed by the tropical sweetness found in rum finished whiskeys. Armida is a journey for the palate: from a brisk northern orchard to an ancient island, it ends up exactly where we intended, with an immensely complex and satisfying whiskey."
258,685,Barrell Bourbon Batch 021,United States,Barrell Craft Spirits,"Bourbon, Whiskey",,53.17%,,10.0,5.0,4,$84.99,,"Barrell Bourbon Batch 021 is the culmination of two separate projects used to contrast one another. The first is a blend of 10-year-old barrels from TN, IN, and KY. We sorted these barrels into 3 groups by their most defining characteristics: one group of the most corn-forward and buttery barrels, one group of the woodiest barrels, and one group of easy-drinking lower proof barrels. The result was three different ingredients, each designed to bring a particular aspect to the final product.

The balancing of these three ingredients proved difficult as the woodier ingredient so easily dominated the other two, but also brought a viscosity and mouth feel that we found very intriguing. Ultimately, we chose to integrate 18 carefully chosen 14-year-old barrels into the final blend. This allowed us to keep the dry, woody, and palate coating characteristics we loved so much in the 10-year-old blend by accenting them with a fruitier, gentler 14-year-old component. The result, Barrell Bourbon Batch 021 is a wonderfully autumnal bourbon, built on a dry toasty backbone with hints of butter and fruit layered in for complexity and contrast.

Appearance: Oiled Leather.

Nose: Opens with a tangy blackberry note supported by a dry oaky character. Blonde tobacco, sunflower seeds, iced tea, and cardamom are gradually joined by a growing peppermint note. Sweeter pastry notes such as cider donut, apricot danish and Turkish delights can be found. While not as floral as some batches, the nose is lifted by Creme Yvette, milkweed, pollen and peach skin. Slate and ginger ale offer a refreshing counterbalance.

Palate: Rich and nutty, cocoa butter supports ample macadamia nut, nougat, and tonka bean. Orange blossom honey and apricot are joined by more exotic notes of rose, loganberry and sumac.

Finish: The blackberry note from the nose returns alongside elderberry, and quince paste that evolve into lingering spicy notes of cocoa nib, aniseed and raspberry leaf."

This bottling is a blend of exclusively American single malt whiskeys. We partnered with small and large producers across the country to select whiskeys that express the full diversity of American terroir and style. The resulting blend is remarkable, and we are proud to be the first to showcase the growing category of American single malt in this way. 

This first release of American Vatted Malt was years in the making, as many of the components in the blend come from emerging distilleries that have never traded or sold bulk whiskey before. The physical and logistical work of sourcing and blending with a group of small, independent producers is neither easy nor short, but we believe it lays the groundwork for a new, exciting, and collaborative future.

We partnered with small and large producers across the country to select whiskeys that express the full diversity of American terroir and style. The resulting blend is remarkable, and we are proud to be the first to showcase the growing category of American single malt in this way. 

We chose the name “American Vatted Malt” as an homage to the old Scottish category of vatted malt, which was once the preferred nomenclature to describe a blended whisky made entirely from single malts. Today, the Scots refer to that style as blended malt, but affection for the term “vatted” lives on.

As a new category, American single malt producers are notoriously creative, looking to their local environment and regional traditions to create distinctive whiskeys. That meant the blend was a challenging one technically, as it asked us to bring together a plethora of unique components. Never before have we strived to balance the distinctive tang of Southwestern mesquite smoke with the sweet and creamy maltiness of malted barley, or contrast briny coastal peat with the warm vanilla character of toasted oak. The resulting blend is complex and multi-faceted, rewarding the drinker with unfolding layers of flavor."

Appearance: Golden Brown with goldenrod highlights and umber lowlights.

Nose: Opens on medjool dates, honeydew melon, butterscotch and light molasses. The nose then expands in many directions at once, evolving additional fruit in the form of Montmorency cherry and dried apricot; floral aromas of apple blossom and fennel pollen; mineral notes of gravel, sea shells, and salt; and some notes that only come from a long, slow maturation, such as Palo Cortado sherry, mastic, and unlit cigar.

Palate: Halva, molasses and chocolate syrup make for a sweet entry, but they’re quickly balanced by tart fruit: kiwi, dragon fruit, and meyer lemon. A subtle array of herbs and spices lend the palate depth, evolving cinnamon, juniper, and anise hyssop.

Finish: Deeper and darker than the palate, its pastry notes are fuller, like oatmeal cookie and ganache; its fruit notes less piquant, such as purple plum, husk cherry and lemon sherbet. Flavors of rosemary and nutmeg recall the spicy and herbaceous notes from before, while a salty touch seems to magnify flavors and make the mouth water for another sip."

We then carefully layered in 13-year Canadian Rye to bring out earthy notes of grass, spearmint and apple. The Indiana Rye was the finishing touch to highlight the candied fruit and spiciness you expect from a rye.

Appearance: A clear auburn with fiery orange highlights.​

Nose: Sweet and earthy, like Indian pudding, halva, and shortbread. That theme is carried forward by corn sprouts, clay pots, honey, almonds, brown sugar and graphite weaving in and out. This is buoyed by bright and acidic kiwi, gooseberry,  lemon curd and black cherry clafouti.​

Palate: The high proof is tempered by rich peanut  butter and a moderate sweetness that carries forward notes of molasses, coconut milk, and sweetened green tea. The relatively modest amount of tannin belies the oaky-driven flavors of pine resin, juniper berry, ginger and leather.

Finish: Holds the earthy theme, beginning with gentian, chewed cigar and mesquite smoke. As it grows gentler, some sweet cream and coconut take over and leave a lingering salty note."

Appearance: Golden light seeps out of a slightly thick backdrop. Each swirl of this unctuous nine-and-a-half-year-old Cask Strength whiskey offers radiant droplets saturated with the natural oils and fats.

Nose: Graham cracker crusted late summer peach cobbler with a deeply tantalizing whiff of both Sherry and splashes of wet saddle leather. Uncured Virginia tobacco leaf spring through a veneer of Rainier Cherry jam melting over sizzling hot rye bread.

Palate: First sips are full of sweet honey swirled deeply with fine sherry wine as they deepen and build into surges of steaming hot, slow cooked, hand ground grits.

Separately, the two whiskeys were finished in either rum casks left over from Barrell Rum Batch 001 production, or rye barrels to add structure and spice. We made four combinations: Tennessee whiskey finished in rum casks, Tennessee whiskey finished in rye barrels, Indiana whiskey finished in rum casks, and Indiana whiskey finished in rye barrels. We then selected and blended a number of barrels of both whiskeys with both finishes to create something really special.

Appearance: Sun dried golden hay at the edges meets deep, viscous butterscotch legs that meld into the burnished copper core.  Spins of the wrist flick light through and across yielding bursts of gold.

Nose: Sweet tropical fruits mixed with deeply saturated wood and banana leaves.  Lingering vanilla and freshly crushed sugar cane melts into corn fritters and citrus oil.

Palate: Creamy milk sugar and caramelized plantains abound amidst smoky homemade butterscotch pudding.  Richly textured, each sip leads to a drying finish that surprises and delights.

Appearance: Burnished cinnamon hues becoming crystal clear at the edges. Tight swirls of the glass bring further bursts of iridescent raw copper, each swirl stained by streaks of late fall.

Appearance: Wildflower honey with brassy highlights.

Nose: Opens rich and fruity, on orange liqueur and maraschino syrup, with underpinnings of cardamom, juniper, and incense.

Palate: The flavor of wildflower honey joins the orange liqueur and sweet vermouth from the nose but these sweet flavors are balanced by tangy pomegranate and strawberry. Subtle notes of dark chocolate and kahlua lend it depth.

Finish: Unexpectedly earthy, with cardamom re-appearing alongside almond, cappuccino, and sumac."

We focused on a balance of richness and depth from the older barrels. The blend mingled for a couple of months to heighten the lushness and complexity. Finally, we methodically layered in 15-year-old barrels to bring out notes of tropical fruit and angelica spice. The result is an evolving bourbon with layers of flavor.

Appearance: A core of zincite ore fades to pale yellow. 

Nose: Opens sweetly, on buttered pancakes with maple syrup and cinnamon donuts. Gradually the aroma shifts to exotic, earthy notes of forest floor, cracked walnut, leather, red miso, and incense. Fruits feel ancillary, but kiwi, white currant, mulled cider and raspberry pastille all make an appearance. The rye spice is pronounced, lending bay leaf, angelica and chocolate mint.

Palate: Gently sweet with chewy tannin, the evolution on the palate mirrors the nose. Honey, coffee cake and a touch of brownie taking the lead. Dry rose follows, on walnut shell, fallen leaves and portobello mushroom; reminiscent of an old Oloroso sherry. There’s a juicy brightness that makes notes of honeydew melon, grenadine and orange zest come alive.

Finish: Cinnamon donut accompanied by nocino, black licorice and tar. As it fades, it softens to leather, orange peel and apple blossom."

The final blend was constructed from four separate lots, each with its own nuanced family of flavors. Much like Batches 007, 011, and 013, Batch 022 incorporates the freshness of some carefully chosen, younger barrels to bring a more extensive set of flavors and aromas to the table.

Appearance: An old leather belt with a polished brass buckle. 

Nose: The rye grain is most immediate, presenting as Yellow Chartreuse and expanding in the direction of juniper berry, cream of fennel soup, and angelica. Woven throughout are delicate florals, alternating between elderflower and wintergreen. Gooseberry jam, kiwi and white peach emerge as a subtle fruitiness. Well-integrated oak lays a gentle foundation of Florentine cookie, vanilla toffee and cola. With time, other themes develop, such as sweet beehive and a savory or umami quality.

Palate: A rich entry- oily and sweet. The creamy texture evokes flan and cappuccino. The oak guides the flavor with sweet tea, s’more, and sugar cane. Root beer and cinchona bark ensure the rye spice is not neglected. Meanwhile, the underlying spirit provides honeysuckle, honeydew melon and candied apricot.

Finish: The sweet tea lingers, accompanied by chicory cafe au lait and Cherry Heering. It fades delicately on rhubarb and peppermint candy."

The base of this blend is 6-year-old barrels but it contains older barrels as well. 

Appearance: Clear edges with gossamer legs meld into a golden honey with a veneer of rose gold and terra cotta.

Nose: Piping hot cornmeal Hush Puppies liberally sprinkled with confectioners’ sugar.  Notes of Cavendish tobacco and bourbon barrels give way to a lush cherry preserves aroma.

Palate: A sharp burst of corn soufflé dissipates into honey graham cracker crusted pecan pie tartlets.  The 114.8 proof provides for a multi-minute finish of hot stone fruit crumble.

Finish: Hot puff pastry filled with stovetop griddled bacon and a touch of dry Burgundy mustard."

Appearance: A core of worn gold transitions through burnt orange to deep russet.

Nose: Starts warm, bursting with fresh, ripe peach atop buttercream frosting. Rich pastry notes of buttered grits, pecan pie, cider donut and chocolate soufflé provide ample depth. The bright meadowy nose evolves through red clover, yellow gentian, marigold and mint tea. There is a slight prickle of toasted oak and mulling spices but seeking beyond them reveals fruit including dried fig, pear, and maraschino cherry. 

Palate: Deep and comforting wintery flavors of kirsch-spiked cocoa, mulled cider and Irish coffee lend tingly warmth to the opening. As bourbon rests on the palate, prickly alcohol invokes peach Bellini and meyer lemon. As it mellows, darker flavors of hazelnut, hickory, dried fig and grains of paradise expand.

Finish: Sweet and savory, as sassafras transitions through chestnut honey and moss before closing out on vanilla meringue and incense."

We started with 10-year-old barrels with a lush, prominent fruit profile and balanced them with 14-year-old oak-forward barrels resulting in a complex bourbon with an engaging brightness.

Appearance: Light amber maple syrup with a burnt sienna core.

Nose: Opens sweetly, showcasing butterscotch, and hazelnut liqueur alongside deeply hued fruity notes of brandy, montmorency cherry, and black currant. With time the nose is lifted by lighter fruits -- pears poached in spiced wine and mirabelle plum; as well as by myriad flowers -- rose, cherry blossom, and hibiscus. Soft, woody spices in the form of star anise, and cedar lend balance while the whole is given depth by a surprising savory side, showcasing pain levain, cultured butter, toasted sesame and enoki mushroom.

Palate: Delivers much of the sweetness of oak without tasting particularly oaky; opening on honey, nougat, nocino, and salmiak. It seems almost roasted, tasting of espresso and charcoal pencil, before notes of oolong tea and forest floor reveal its depth.

Finish: Quite intense, with an array of fruits, particularly cranberry and kumquat, enlivened by a mineral signature of salt, graphite, rock pools and mastic. It fades gently on an assortment of spices, aniseed, licorice, cocoa nib, and hyssop."

The broad-brush strokes of cinnamon-laced apple butter pensively reveal crushed pink peppercorns. A mere prickle from the 124.7 Proof alcohol leads head over heels into the lengthy finish redolent of fresh corn on the cob dressed in salted butter.

Appearance: A reddish amber hue undulates from light to dark when swirled to settle in viscous sheets along the circumference of the glass.​

Nose: Grilled figs and vanilla syrup summon forth subtler notes of caraway seed, dried pear, and pencil lead. Finishes with the lingering air of a smoldering oak bonfire mixing with the morning dew.

Palate: Savory notes of ripe summer peaches yield to treacle across the back of the teeth. Each measured sip reveals sultry flavors of freshly pulled pralines, cherries, and breakfast meats. The 124.7 Proof “tingle” across the tongue and roof of the mouth is assertive and memorable yet not overpowering.

Finish: Rare, spicy La Perique pipe tobacco preludes a multi-minute ending of brûléed corn pudding dusted with fleur de sel and sweet maple syrup."

Appearance: Mahogany veneer leading to motes of shimmering gold leaf melting deeply into the center of the tasting glass. Glistening and clear at the edges, natural fats and oils trail slowly down the glass, each swirl of the glass offers lush prisms of hand polished copper. 

Nose: Forest floor of crushed leaves melds into a flaky, lard-spun pie crust laid over homemade mincemeat. Bacon fat and dark brown sugar toasted nuts come into the forefront, along with licks of slow cooked bone broth woven with tangles of sweet and toasty wood smoke.

Palate: Vast slabs of gingerbread toasted over a cast iron pan until just charred, scattered with oven roasted currants and pools of dark Jamaican Rum cream. Each sip of the 107.6 proof heat is beguiling as it rolls over the tongue.

Finish: Split, buttered and griddled diner-style corn muffins slowly give way to richer notes of creamed corn with an undercurrent of cedar shavings. Fire burnished marshmallow crusts are redolent of Café du Monde Beignets sifted with powdered sugar."

The ages range from 9 year 9 months to 15-years-old. Deeply concentrated but not too oaky, this bourbon is unique due to the barrels being selected for similar qualities despite being different ages and coming from different distilleries.
​
Appearance: Polished copper with edges fracturing into a spectrum ranging from marigold to pollen.

Nose: Sweet on the nose and exhibiting a well-integrated depth of oak. The aroma is packed with cherry clafoutis, kouign-amann, pecan pie, and cinnamon roll. This is balanced by oaky spice (nutmeg, marshmallow root, cocoa powder) and oak-derived notes that only come from slow maturation (moss, candied praline, unlit cigar, sandalwood). Fruity notes of rubbed orange and lime peel, umeboshi, dried apricot, fresh peach tantalize along with ever present intriguing mineral notes of flint, slate, and iron.

Palate: The texture is sweet and oily, deeply flavorful without any woody bitterness. Coconut oil and honeycomb provide a rich backdrop for bright notes of peach, milk chocolate, Italian roast coffee and barrel char.

Finish: Blackberry and elderberry come to the fore as the mineral notes of graphite, slate, iron, copper, salt broaden. All this is overlaid atop molasses."

Appearance: Sherry cobbler.

Nose: Waffle soaked with syrup and honey roasted cashew. Subtle, herbaceous accents color the aroma: Benedictine liqueur, eucalyptus, Saaz hops and fried sage. Fruity notes are more subdued, though gooseberry, Mirabelle plum and orange zest lurk beneath the surface. Ginger ale and cardamom barrel spice settle over the top.

Palate: The initial impression is of power, but it’s checked and balanced by its breadth and complexity. Like the nose, sweet notes are most apparent, those of salted caramel, marzipan, coconut milk and sabayon. The herbs, too, are present: rosemary, Jasmine tea and the leafiness of an Oloroso sherry. Pops of nectarine and lemon cordial round out the proceedings.

Finish: Clean and consistent, Rainier cherry, amaretto, peaches and cream, and a touch of salt."

The result is complex and thoughtful - a nicely balanced spicy bourbon.

Appearance: Rose gold with a light copper center.

Nose: An impatient sniff off the freshly opened bottle is rewarded with an incredibly vivid aroma of honey. A delicate balance of spirit-driven dried fruit, including fig, cranberry, apple, and raisin, and oak-driven baking spices of cinnamon and chai tea. This is underpinned by deeper, grain-driven notes of whole wheat sourdough. With time the nose grows sweeter and creamier, with notes of, lime curd, milk chocolate, and amaretto. The fruit grows brighter, evolving into apricot and passion fruit with a touch of green peppercorn.

Palate: The mouth feel is sweet and rounded like a fine calvados but the flavors are lively, almost effervescent. Opens on honey, apricot, white tea, and marigold, with delicately bitter notes of tulsi. This is balanced with soft, crushed almond, maple syrup, and oyster mushroom. Patience is rewarded with warm almond croissant, macadamia nut, nutmeg, and a burst of passion fruit.

Finish: Brings candied cherry, cinnamon, and angostura bitters, like the last sip of a beautifully balanced Manhattan."

As a result, tropical fruit notes resonate amidst the mellow warmth.  For those in search of full barrel proof flavors without high rick house heat, this is the bourbon for you.  

Appearance: Broiled apricot orange at the core and resplendent warm gold at the edges. Sunlight reflecting off of burnished copper flashes across the surface leaving iridescent streaks with each swirl. 

Nose: Slowly roasted exotic fruits like kiwi, coconut, and Satsuma orange swirled with smoked bergamot tea. Herbed brown butter dripping over toasted brioche and northwest cherry.

Palate: Lively and amusing across the palate, the mellow warmth makes this bourbon easy to enjoy. Future sips touch all parts of the palate with broad strokes of thick clotted cream. The glow of the 112.10 proof lurks just out of sight, a welcome but not distracting figure.

Finish: Oven dried stone fruit jam with a hint of citrus oils leads to Caribbean spices. The multi-minute finish is reminiscent of sweet buttered carnival corn."

It’s the classic 10-year-old: high proof and balanced, oak driven but complex. This batch is our tribute to the elegant bourbons of the past. 

Appearance: Burnt sienna with bronze highlights.

Nose: An inviting aroma of mulled cider with cinnamon, ginger and nutmeg opens the proceedings. The impression of early-autumn is strengthened by aromas of cherry pie, purple plums, funnel cakes and a mug of chamomile tea with orange blossom honey. With time, delicate notes of honeydew melon, meyer lemon, cuban mint and apple blossom float from the glass.

Palate: Very rich, almost buttery, but balanced by an unexpectedly tropical, juicy side. The opening takes its cue from the nose, exhibiting pound cake and apple jelly, before an cascade of fruits rush in: pineapple, passion fruit, mirabelle plums, gooseberries, lime cordial and guava paste. Flavors of Chartreuse and sweet vermouth lend breadth and the whole is kept in check by little graphite minerality.

Finish: The tropical and herbaceous themes remain but the more delicate floral and mineral notes shine as the whiskey fades, with flavors meadowsweet and tonic water lingering at the end."

This gentler aging style makes Batch 012 a fruit-forward bourbon that shows its spice in the mid-palate, and its drawn out complexity in a long, layered finish. 

Appearance: Deep amber at the core melting to rose gold and brightly polished copper, rimmed by clear edges marbled with wildflower honey.

Nose: Elaborate and indulgent nose of rich orange curd, strawberry, and bursts of sea foam, with licks of pumpkin pie and wet Spanish saddle leather.

Palate: Creamy textures abound with luxurious dabs of fresh whipped cream spooned over long simmered hot chocolate.  English summer ale at the top of the tongue gives rise to mid-range notes of crushed Oreo cookie leading into the 108.5 proof finish.

Finish: Minced cigar and pipe tobacco meld with slow cooked summer peach pie.  Hints of sea smoke, crushed salt-slicked rocks and pork cracklings round out the finish."

This sweetness dissipates into dried licks of cedar-tinged lead pencil shavings. There is assertiveness to each sip; this whiskey is both sophisticated and confident. The Bourbon 004 merely whispers the 116.7 proof with raw honey in the finish that eventually leads to a long and salty peanut brittle ending.

Appearance: Robust and amber hued, thickly textured across the tongue and indulgent in the pour.

Nose: Cast iron pan cooked cornbread right up front, slathered with hand-crushed Tellicherry peppercorns and served alongside slowly barbecued turkey wings.

Palate: Crushed limestone redolent with firm- yet well balanced hints of Caribbean baking spices and deeply scented peach butter across the tongue and lips.

Finish: Both luxurious and pertinent with a finish that turns quickly into dribs of saddle leather and deeper notes of burning tobacco."

A month later, bottles of Barrell Bourbon Batch 007 had flown off the shelf faster than we ever could have imagined. And so, back to the old, Old Taylor warehouse we went to load up the remaining barrels of Batch 007 and truck them down to the bottling line. When we tasted them again, something had changed. In a mere 14 weeks the onset of summer, the agitation of two truck rides, and the general mystery of Bourbon maturation had taken hold. We had a much woodier, mellower Bourbon at a slightly lower proof. This was not our light and buttery Barrell Bourbon Batch 007 anymore, but it still WAS barrels from batch 007... and Batch 008 was already on the way. Our solution? Barrel Bourbon Batch 007b, our smallest batch yet.

Appearance: Deeply golden and viscous with soft, clear edges contrasting with swirls of darkness in the middle.  Further movement reveals dense, natural fats and oils that funnel downwards, punctuated by soft globules of butter and cocoa nib with hints of charred cornhusk.

Nose: Deep warming throughout the depths of your olfactory make for a profound and textured scent.  Sweet smokiness accentuated by the impression of Caribbean spices and tropical cane sugar.  Each nasal inhale begets another, increasing the aromatic sense of sweet plums and their drying pits.

Palate: Soft and lustrous across the tongue with opulent richness and concentration that entices.

Finish: Slowly cooked nutmeat interspersed with sweet apricot marmalade.  Each drop tantalizes with suggestions of graham crusted banana cream pie in a luxuriously sensual and multi-minute conclusion."

Appearance: Shimmering mahogany at the core encompassed by layers of polished gold leaf.

Nose: Roasted almond, white tobacco flowers and cracklings flow into droplets of brown butter, new saddle leather and citrus zest.

Palate: Cavendish pipe tobacco, spicy corn bread with raw honey cream, thick lemon curd and dry straw.

Finish: Tangy wood smoke, raw honey syrup and blood orange."

After these were blended together, 13 and 15-year-old barrels with more wood tannins and depth were layered in and a select number of 9-year-old barrels with a higher rye content were blended in for spice and assertiveness. Finally, 5 and 8-year-old wheated bourbon barrels were added to soften the batch, brighten the front palate, and solidify a cohesiveness to an otherwise extremely complex flavor profile. 

Appearance: Carrot.

Nose: Supporting notes that span sweet desserts, woodsy herbs, and rich oils, but their presence is an afterthought to the singular and intense focus of this whisky’s nose, and that focus is squarely on old, comforting cherry. Deeper bass notes of sweet potato pie, walnut shells, and freshly ground coffee flesh out the aromatic register. The influence of rye is subtle here, potpourri, earl grey tea, and bouquet garni whisper at the periphery.

Palate: The candied texture that falls short of syrupy and a just-gentle tannin suggest minimal oak extraction but significant concentration over long years spent slowly evaporating in a rickhouse. Like the nose, a bright, juicy acidity puts the focus squarely on a note of cherry. A bit more floral than the nose, candied violet and lavender are just able to peek through, along with a steely minerality. 

Finish:  A gentle, yet complex finish that makes one imagine a flavor wheel in thin air. This mysterious yet fruity bourbon leaves the palate with blood orange , rosehip, hibiscus, and sumac."

Appearance: Dark honey with ginger highlights. 

Nose: Rich, deeply fruited and subtly spiced with slivered almonds, prunes, and black currents. Coffee notes are followed by soft oak, licorice, and vanilla flecked whipped cream atop hot cocoa, reminiscent of a finely aged Armagnac. 

Palate: Like your first bite of a cheerily iced gingerbread man and rounded out by Twix candy bar, hazelnut cappuccino, and fig jam. The mouthfeel grows syrupy as it sits on the palate.

The first was a fusion of 9-year-old high rye barrels peppery and pointed on the palate, 10-year-old oak forward barrels, and sweet, toasty 11-year-old barrels for mouthfeel and classic baking spice notes. The second balanced citrus forward 10, 12 and 15-year-old barrels with spicy, floral 9-year-old high rye barrels. These two blends were gradually co-mingled resulting in an intriguing bourbon that dances between fruit and spice long into its finish.

FLAVOR NOTES

Like a well-aged Sauternes, a complex array of fresh, dried, and cooked fruits dominates the aroma, supported by pungent florals and a delicate layer of barrel-spice. The palate is concentrated and extractive, having pulled quite a lot of sugar and peppery spice from the cask. Water tames it, bringing forth a panoply of tropical fruits on the nose and creamy desserts on the palate.

Neat

Appearance: Pumpkin pie. 

Nose: Immediately bright and fruity, smelling of white peach, creamy coconut, and prickly rhubarb, followed by dried or cooked fruits, among them golden raisin, candied grapefruit peel, and roasted red pepper. Pungent florals are intermixed, notably rosehip and meadowsweet. As one’s nose adjusts, richer, sweeter notes of beeswax, toasted almond, and tiramisu arrive. They sit atop a dusting of allspice, spearmint, ginger ale and charcoal.

Palate: A bit brash, but well balanced and with only modest tannin. Initially the flavor is dark and complex, on molasses, black cherry soda, and root beer barrel candy. The palate is rounded out by slate, salt, green apple and a little horseradish.

Finish: Advances the cooked-fruit theme put forth by the nose, cycling through candied grapefruit peel, grape jam, cardamom and allspice. It fades with a mineral tingle of iron and wood smoke.

With a few drops of spring water

Tropical fruit aromas become the focus, particularly starfruit, pineapple, and limoncello. Geranium and vanilla lend to the exotic feeling. The palate grows richer and silkier, with toasted pumpernickel, quince paste, mocha and horchata."

Appearance: Sugar just beginning to caramelize.

Nose: Heady and intense, with a first impression of summer rain, sea salt, and slate. This bourbon quickly opens to pineapple, cranberry, and crushed apple. Cumin, caraway and grains of paradise announce the presence of woodsy oak spice. As the senses are acclimated, a richer bouquet is revealed, with tahini, macadamia nut, leather, and roast pork.

Palate: Where the nose only hinted at oak, the palate explodes with it. There is gripping tannin, manuka honey, and the herbaceous complexity of an old world digestif. As a sip is held, it grows sweeter and mellower, tasting of French vanilla ice cream and coffee liqueur.

Finish: The fruits return as fassionola syrup, and Italian stone fruit, rounded out with roasted chestnut. It fades on hickory smoke and black pepper.

With a splash of spring water: The nose gets creamier: banana, candied lemon and jammy apricot joining the pineapple to create a tropical fruit smoothie. A touch of juiced wheatgrass lends a hoppy vibe. The palate grows spicier, with fiery cinnamon joined by juniper berry and catnip before fading on chewing tobacco."

Appearance: Dark amber with a deep mahogany core and narrow edges of golden sunlight.  Turns of the wrist create tantalizing combinations of molten copper.

Nose: Caramelized Granny Smith apple pie with orange zest and Madagascar vanilla paste.  Tangy Yuzu, aged saddle leather, and warm dark chocolate ganache.

Appearance: Warm, autumnal resins, blending together from afar.

Nose: The central theme is of pie, notably Boston cream and pecan. Armagnac, and fig jam lend a dense, dark fruitiness. Herbal notes constantly pop to the fore and then gently ebb, cycling through spearmint, ginger ale and pandan leaf. The bottom register ranges between sweet and savory; from maple syrup on one side through halva and soufflé, to gorgonzola on the other.

Palate: Medium bodied with relatively fine tannin. The oak makes its presence known first, tasting woodsy and also bringing along oak-derived notes of coconut meat and vanilla. Sweeter elements include chocolate, honeycomb, maple syrup and beet reduction. These are tempered by the dry spice of Ramazzotti amaro, black coffee and spearmint.

Finish: Quite intense, on bold notes of campfire, black coffee and cocoa powder. Grows gentler as it fades, revealing s’mores, ground clove, and fruity bursts of maraschino liqueur, black cherry and nicoise olive."

On the nose, an array of fresh, primary fruits sits atop a creamy base of horchata and toasted nuts. The palate starts bright and fresh, but water unlocks a whole beehive’s worth of flavor- honey, wax, flowers and pollen.

Appearance: Goldenrod fading to a rim of lemon chiffon.

Nose: Distillate driven, but with ample variety of primary fruit flavors, among them gooseberry, apple, watermelon rind, and peach. The oak is fresh but quite gentle, smelling of vanilla, toasted coconut, and sawdust. Corn lends a strong creamy foundation of toasted almond, lemon curd, and baguette. Cilantro and wintergreen hint at some light rye spice.

Palate: Despite the strength and minimal tannin, sweetness lends a clear weight to the palate. It opens fresh and grassy, on Yorkshire pudding with mushy peas, genepy, and thyme. As it sits on the palate, juicy fruits emerge, notably persimmon, raisin, and black tea with lemon.

Finish: An initial burst of minerals: limestone, flint, and steel. These give way to a potpourri of herbs and spices: apple blossom, hyssop, wild mint and clove."

Filled into Fresh Bourbon and Grenache Blanc casks, it spent the next decade slumbering in P2, the ancient stone warehouse in the village of Port Charlotte, close to the western shore of Loch Indaal.

In this second edition of ten year old, the unique texture of Octomore is lifted further by the smooth, sweet fruit of Grenache and engages perfectly with the phenolic depth. Just 18,000 bottles exist, presented at 57.3% alc.vol. with a splash of Islay spring water. 18,000 individually numbered bottles only.

NOSE
The Octomore DNA is evident as soon as the cork is popped. The smoke is closely intertwined with the rich and fruity toasted oak of the Grenache casks. Wisps of smoky iodine, leather, polish, Nutella, ginger syrup, walnuts and orange peels compete for your attention before allowing the fruit to come into its own as lemon and green apples are held together in the grip of the typical Octomore smoky, salty rope, marine character.

PALATE
The heat from the natural strength is tempered by the wonderful texture in this whisky, not only has 10 years of maturation in fabulous American Bourbon and French Grenache casks allowed the phenol level to calm it has allowed the viscous, oil rich body of the whisky to build a strong confident character. The balance of smoke, oak and fruit is different from other Octomores, as the phenols naturally fade with age the fabulous casks develop a strong hold on the spirit, salted caramel, marzipan vanilla and crusty malty bread.

FINISH
Given time eventually the power will fade, though after a couple of sips you may be forgiven for thinking your palate is altered forever as the smoke ligers for fully an hour! As ever the dry peat smoke will be the last flavour to remain reminiscent of pipe tobacco ash and peat tea, an island delicacy of tea brewed over a peat fire while gathering peats on the moss. this whisky is scarce, if you are lucky enough to taste it, treasure it.

MOOD
This dram is bright and honest and has depth and backbone. Watching this spirit is develop is a privilege as there is a feeling with Octomore that there will always be a secret to revealed."

This is a rare and exceptional signature Bruichladdich spirit. Oloroso sherry butts used to be widely available but are becoming increasingly difficult to find now as sherry sales and production continues to decline. Ironically as the availability of sherry casks declines Bruichladdich is starting to use French wine casks in which to mature its whiskies; in fact it was the prolonged wars with France in the 19th century when British traders couldn’t source French casks that British merchants developed trading routes with Spain and other countries in Europe, which itself developed demand for sherry in the UK as an alternative to wine, and it was these butts which the scotch whisky industry used in the absence of French wine casks. The combination of the rich Oloroso sherry influence and full term maturation in Islay’s marine climate creates Bruichladdich’s richest full bodied whisky to date."

These component parts have been combined and matured for an extra year in the finest French oak from the Bordeaux left bank.

Nose – Initially you are met with a summer fruit and peat smoke extravaganza! Raspberry and cherry, with Turkish delight and smoky driftwood embers burst from the glass jostling for attention. There is a distinctly summer feel to this dram, no brooding peat monster it has a light, bright and fruity air. As the whisky opens you find the Islay sea breeze, ozone and salty. The oak, both American and French give real depth to the dram, classic vanilla, toasted bread, chocolate, roasted coffee beans, liquorice walnut and almond. Each time you go back to the glass there seems to be a bubble of red berry and ripe plum bursting under your nose.

Palate – Certainly warming at 59.2%, lively and sweet with icing sugar and marshmallow, bound in smoke. There is a rush to capture all that is taking place. Sweet red fruit and peat smoke melt away slightly as the power of the oak comes through with tobacco leaf and toasted oak. Maple syrup, pecan and coffee are complimented by hints of orange and cooked peach. There is a complexity here that didn’t seem possible on the first sip. As you go back to the glass that initial rush of flavour has become a more complete experience. Nowthere is salt spray, dry smoke and the oak is more prominent, raspberry and plum combine with vanilla and butterscotch.

Finish – On the finish the peat smoke is a little more medicinal than normal, think bandages and creosote. A dryness from the oak tells of the toasting of the French and the char of the American and the final combination in premium French oak together. The influence of the extra maturation in sumptuous first growth casks has added a layer of fruit that weaves its way through the smoke and into the heart of the whisky. The spirit is viscous and textured allowing a long finish where creamy vanilla, spicy clove and ripe peach melt away from the powerful peat smoke allowing it to finish alone, leaving the Port Charlotte DNA firmly in place.

Character – Lively, sunny, rosy, a wonderful experience and superb combination of fruit laden French oak, strong peat smoke and Islay maturation."

This Speyside single malt Scotch whisky boasts a delicate balance of sweet summer fruits and spring flowers. You will also notice aromas of pineapple, pear, toasted cereal and honey, the latter of which shows up again on the finish.

The Glenlivet distilled in pots that still use 100 percent malted barley. It is then aged in traditional European and bourbon-seasoned American oak casks to bring forth the delectable flavors. Despite being produced in Scotland, The Glenlivet is the bestselling malt whisky in the United States. It is also the second-best single malt in the world, so you know you're buying the good stuff!

No other malt whisky has the legendary status enjoyed by The Glenlivet 12 Year. Its smooth character and tropical fruity notes make it a first-class malt, along with the mineral-rich spring water drawn from the distillery's historic well.

So, what does ""single malt"" mean, anyway? Single malt whisky is simply a malted whisky that has been made from a single distillery. As for the malted part, the whisky is made using malted grains as opposed to unmalted ones. According to Scotch Whisky Regulations, single malt Scotch whisky must be made with malted barley, distilled in a single distillery using pot stills and aged for at least three years. The Glenlivet, being a 12-year Scotch, is aged for 12. It's also a Speyside single malt Scotch, which means that it's produced in the River Spey region in northeastern Scotland.

The Glenlivet 12 Year is a vibrant gold hue with a summery nose. Since its palate is well balanced with forward tropical fruit notes, it's best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a little water added. At the finish, you'll savor a smooth creaminess with hints of fresh hazelnuts and marzipan.

Pair The Glenlivet with seafood dishes, such as seared scallops, to bring out the best characteristics in both. Even if you've never tasted a malt whisky before, The Glenlivet will make anyone a fan.

The Limousin oak used is cut in France’s Dordogne region, where it’s often used to mature cognacs. Its low density allows whisky to sink deep into the wood, and The Glenlivet distillers carefully control how long the whisky matures in the casks so as not to overpower the desired result: a unique, pleasing spiciness."

Why, you make it yourself. Balvenie believes in mastering and controlling the Five Crafts of whisky: barley, malt, stills, barrels and the malt master.

They handle every aspect of creating The Balvenie 12 year Doublewood, from the first seed to the final approval of Malt Master David C. Stewart, whose nose and palate have been sharpened at the distillery since 1962.

The Balvenie presents the ultimate line of painstakingly crafted Scotch whiskies. The Double Wood ages 12 years in American Oak Bourbon barrels, then finishes in Spanish Oak Sherry casks. The final product carries the sweet fruit from the Sherry, charred notes from the Bourbon and the character of a meticulous crew of craftspeople.

This Speyside whisky tastes fine after dinner or with a Maduro cigar. The nose carries dark chocolate, raspberries and fresh bread. The taste blends berries and cherries with pepper and exotic spices. The finish is long and viscous with lingering hints of red fruit.

The 12 Year is a great addition to your Scotch collection. You'll have some Highland, Islay, Lowland and Cambeltown, but this is one of the only whiskies you'll find aged in two different barrels. It sets itself apart.

How should you drink it? Pour it in your favorite straight-sided glass, neat. Put a glass of ice or water next to it. Some sippers like a splash of water ""to wake up the whisky."" Have your first sip straight, then drop in a cube to cool it a touch. The water will expand the flavor. Any way you have it, you'll taste the love and care of dedicated distillers.

The smell offers a rich aroma of passion fruit, other tropical scents and rich toffee. When you take a drink, you'll get flavors of sweet vanilla, mango, apple and just a touch of orange. As you enjoy the whiskey, you'll notice that the finish sticks around, offering a vanilla tone. The overall balance of The Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 Year is something you'll love from the very first taste.

Using home-grown barley, The Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 Year is a masterpiece from start to finish. Unlike many scotch and whiskey brands out there, The Balvenie still uses a floor malting process. They steep the barley in water then spread it across the floor. It is turned and malted by hand, which is a long and difficult process.

Once the liquid for The Balvenie Caribbean Cask 14 Year has been made it's aged in oak casts. After 14 years, it is moved into Caribbean rum casks to get some extra flavor before being sold.

It's unlikely that you'll want to mix anything with it. The flavors are too unique to pass up. When you're pouring yourself a glass of this 14 Year scotch, consider the three most popular options: neat, on the rocks or with a splash of water.

Stewart MBE and our former distillery manager Ian Millar.

At a time when few Speyside distilleries were using peat in production, The Balvenie decided to distil a batch of heavily peated malt, which was laid down to mature at the distillery in Dufftown, Scotland.

Ever since then we’ve dedicated one week each year, named Peat Week, to using 100% Highland peat to dry our barley. Instead of coastal elements of iodine, salt and medicinal characteristics so commonly associated with Islay peat, Highland peat imparts earthy, woody smoke notes. This means that even though Peat Week is made using heavily peated malt (30ppm) it has an unexpected sweetness deeply rooted in the Speyside regional character.

The Balvenie Peat Week Aged 14 Years (2002 Vintage) is a single vintage bottling, limited and rare by nature. This non-chill filtered expression is bottled at 48.3% ABV and matured solely in American Oak casks, providing a velvety and round taste with woody peat smoke balancing oaky vanilla and honey."

The result pays homage to the casks’ southern Spanish origins - a rich and intense single malt, characterised by mixed spice and sweet sherry fruitiness.

Rich and intense with complex layers of sherried oak, spiced apples, caramelised pears and toasted almonds, the aroma of The Balvenie SherryOak also intrigues with hints of beeswax, fresh ground spices and a subtle earthiness.

On the palate, first impressions are of mixed spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, cloves) combined with sweet, fruity, sherried flavours.

The casks that had originally held the peated liquid had taken on much of its character and so David decided to experiment by filling them with 17 year old Balvenie for a short period. The result was an intensely peaty whisky. Marrying this liquid with 17 year old Balvenie finished in new American oak casks produced The Balvenie Peated Cask, a complex single malt that is rich and spicy with layers of smokiness."

Orchard fruit notes are common to both Calvados and Scotch malt whisky. Many Calvados producers double-distil in pot stills, just like their Scottish cousins. Maturation in French oak is another aspect of their shared DNA.

These two spirits share richness, sweetness and complexity; the Calvados lends an intensity and length to the finish which enhances the character of the Scotch whiskies.

They went on a big campaign around the U.S., literally rolling barrels of whisky through the streets of major American cities, where people could sign the barrels and record their own dreams onto the wood. That's a great story, but it doesn't make the whisky taste any better, does it? Luckily for Glenfiddich they've created a delicious single malt that lives up to the hype they've invested in it. After transporting the decorated casks back to Scotland, the unused American oak was filled with whisky aged 14 years and older where it rested for three months, picking up more vanilla from the uncharred wood. The barrels were then blended together to create a limited, 3500 bottle American release that's definitely worth any single malt drinker's time. There's a lot of vanilla - a ton of it - but it's never overpowering. Lively spices, sweet grains, high-toned fruits, and supple caramel all come at once, dodging in and out over the palate. Everything stays completely in balance and the finish leaves trails of resin with cloves and rich oak. Best of all, they bottled it at 48.8% which gives the whisky the heft it needs to battle all that flavor. Glenfiddich never seems to excite the more experienced malt drinker, but I think that's all about to change. This is much better than last year's Snow Phoenix, so they're listening to our feedback! -David Driscoll, Spirits Buyer"

Not only is it named after the boyhood home of Abraham Lincoln, it has some highly acclaimed brothers in the Jim Beam family: Booker's, Basil Hayden's and Baker's.

Aged nine years, Knob Creek is the oldest by a couple years. The extra aging draws more flavor and sugar from the wood, providing a full-bodied, fruity flavor with hints of grass and grain. It's 100-proof, which is considered the honest age of bourbons made a century ago. The Beam family makes this spirit with extra char on white oak barrels for a bigger flavor.

Knob Creek Bourbon is comfortable on the top shelf of any home bar. You should put it right up there with the best names from Tennessee, Ireland, Canada or Scotland. It's a great dessert after a grilled steak and is at home with a cigar next to your ash tray.

How does it mix? Its bold, organic flavor stands up well in cocktails if you must mix it. Fresh mint and a hint of sugar make a fine Julep. It makes a nice old fashioned with orange, bitters and a cherry. The family suggests you try a new fashioned. Instead of sugar, use Amaretto as a sweetener. Mix that with bitters and an orange peel. Serve it up or on the rocks.

Whatever you do, taste it with a little extra patience. It spent nine long years getting to you. Don't rush it.

Batch 1 Description: Higher in sweet notes, vanilla and caramel, very smooth
Batch 2 Description: Higher in wood, oak notes and more astringent
Batch 3 Description: Mid-way between the other two batches but favors more of the woody notes"

One such trail led to the banks of the Kentucky River where Buffalo Trace Distillery has been making bourbon whiskey the same way for more than 200 years. In tribute to the mighty buffalo and the rugged, independent spirit of the pioneers who followed them, we created our signature Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey.

Buffalo Trace Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is distilled, aged and bottled at the most award-winning distillery in the world. Made from the finest corn, rye and barley malt, this whiskey ages in new oak barrels for years in century old warehouses until the peak of maturity. The taste is rich and complex, with hints of vanilla, toffee and candied fruit. The smooth finish lingers on the palate. This will never change.

TASTING NOTES
This deep amber whiskey has a complex aroma of vanilla, mint and molasses. Pleasantly sweet to the taste with notes of brown sugar and spice that give way to oak,  toffee, dark fruit and anise. This whiskey finishes long and smooth with serious depth.

Those brave pioneers distilled whiskey using traditional methods and drank it right off the still. They called it White Dog. This raw distillate was clear, un-aged and had a hint of sweet corn. Later distillers discovered this spirit was perfect for aging - creating what we know today as fine Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey. We’re still making whiskey on the spot where ancient buffalo once crossed the Kentucky River and following centuries of time-honored distilling tradition.

In June of 2011, the company bottled this single barrel of whiskey, which yielded 174 handwritten and individually numbered bottles. Each Millennium Barrel bottle was packaged in a numbered hardwood showcase box that includes a piece of the historic barrel's charred oak stave. Buffalo Trace Distillery then offered all 174 bottles to non-profit organizations wishing to raise funds for their charity.

Altogether, $152,557 dollars were raised for needy organizations all the way from New York to California. Organizations supporting child care, senior care, Red Cross, the Ronald McDonald House, Humane Societies, Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Wildlife Centers, and many more were able to benefit from the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 

Some of the top fundraising organizations found resourceful ways to make the most of their piece of history. The Indiana State University Foundation, based in Terre Haute, was the top fundraiser with $7,000 raised. To do this, they got creative with a trip to Kentucky, tour of bourbon country, and visit to Buffalo Trace Distillery in Frankfort. At the end of their evening, their Buffalo Trace tour guide drew the winning name for the Millennium Barrel bottle. The group consisted of alumni and friends of Indiana State University. The cost per participant covered the travel and expenses and entry into the drawing for the Millennium Barrel bottle. 

The Preble County Historical Society in Ohio raised $4,100 by offering an exclusive whiskey tasting, followed by a first-class dinner. 

""We're thrilled so many deserving organizations benefited from our Millennium Barrel,"" said Kris Comstock, bourbon brand manager. ""To help raise over $150,000 for worthwhile causes feels wonderful."""

And Canada’s massive forests and unique climate have shaped Quercus alba into a tree all its own.

To compare: the American white oaks harvested and used in whiskey barrels across the world tend to come from forests that stretch from the Great Lakes to Tennessee, and from the Mississippi to the Atlantic. It’s an area with long growing seasons and hot, humid summers. In those conditions, the oaks grow fast, leading to a wider-grained wood that, when made into barrels, readily shares its flavors with the whiskey that ages within.

Our ""experiments and tasting competitions taught us that Centennial hops were some of the best hops possible,"" says Bell. Centennial Hops were first created in 1974 and boast an alpha acid rating of 9.5%-11.5%, resulting in a slightly floral flavor profile that is ideal for making pale ales and India pale ales. After Corsair Centennial Malt Whiskey is distilled with the hops, it is aged in new, American oak casks until it reaches its peak flavor. As a result, the whiskey has a sweet aroma, with touches of rose petals and orange zest. Notes of caramelized oranges and sweet malt dominate the flavor profile, and lead to a finish accented by balanced hops and sweet citrus.    Corsair Galaxy Malt Whiskey is also distilled from malted barley, but is flavored with Galaxy hops rather than Centennial hops. Bred in 1994, Galaxy hops are an Australian high alpha dual purpose triploid varietal often used to produce beers such as IPAs. The hops have an aroma of grapefruit and intense citrus, and contribute slightly milder notes of tropical fruits to the whiskey. Following distillation, Corsair Galaxy Whiskey is also aged in new, American oak casks.    Corsair Rasputin Hopped Whisky is also crafted with malted barley, and is flavored with Rasputin hops before being matured in American oak casks. Rasputin hops are often used to craft beers such as stouts, and produce a slightly darker and more grainy flavor profile. As a result, Corsair Rasputin Hopped Whisky has a malty aroma, with hints of pale ale, dark caramel and mint. The aroma gives way to notes of oak, whipped cream and a hint of bananas.

This Rye whiskey was aged inside the Willett warehouses in Bardstown for 7 years. The story gets a little more interesting and now drifts over to Europe. During a trip to France, Willett Master Distiller and Blender Drew Kulsveen had an opportunity to see how the orange liqueur known as Curacao was made.    The barrels that were used to age the citrus-flavored spirit were actually used Bourbon barrels, which was a factor for Drew believing they may produce a nice barrel finish for some of the Rye he had aging. So after bringing 25 of the Curacao casks from France back to Kentucky, Drew and his team needed 42 barrels of the 7 year-old Rye to fill them up (remember, after 7 years of aging those barrels were not full due to angel’s share/evaporation) and allowed the whiskey to age for another 90 days inside those barrels.    After three months the barrels were all dumped together and bottled as a small batch, sticking to Willett’s philosophy of bottling small batches at 20-25 barrels. This yielded 6,912 bottles, which might sound like a lot, but considering Willett is now in 35 states and 25 countries, this release is very highly allocated.    This release got its own packaging as well, which was also inspired by Drew. The label is one of a puppeteer that is pulling the strings on dangling barrels.    The image gives folks the idea of the Willett crew playing around with barrels, which is what the company is most known for since they’ve only been distilling on site for just over two years, but they’ve been mastering the art of whiskey maturation on their family’s property for over three decades. XCF comes in at 103.4 proof, and was slightly cut down from the 115 proof it was when originally dumped from the Curacao casks. Retail price is around $200.   Willett Exploratory Cask"

Having been passed from owner to owner over the years, playing a ‘bit-part actor’ role in producing whisky for the big blenders and having been a relatively small distillery, Bladnoch lacked identity as a single malt.

Further to this, the profile of spirit produced here was dramatically altered to suit blending operations of its parent company at the time, giving single malt expressions a schizophrenic identity over the years.

Don’t judge a book by its cover! Bladnoch’s celebrated style is beautifully delicate and grassy; and if you find a vintage from a healthy, well-made cask then you’ll be subject to the most amazing citrusy bouquet of lemon and green apple, followed by subtle, playful layers of complexity.

Much like its cousin distillery, Dalmore, the production process at Fettercairn starts by creating a particularly heavy, cereal-led wash, but during distillation cooling water is used – here using a cooling ring; at Dalmore using water jackets – which promotes reduction of heaviness within the final spirit.

He wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.

No rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.

The result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.

This collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.

If you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.

For your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

The scotch is full-bodied and smoky with a lovely residual sweetness that complements its hints of seaweed and salt. After noting its peaty characteristics, discover a warming finish that lingers in the throat and beckons the taster for more.

It's no secret that Scotland is renowned for its whiskies. Iodine-rich scotch from the Islay region is among the country's most characterful drams, with Laphroaig offering one of the most exceptional medicinal malts. The Laphroaig 10 Year is the company's entry-level scotch, which boasts a medium caramel color when poured into a glass. Scents of smoke, decay, salt, charcoal, leather and wet stone hit the nose, opening up to herbal ocean tones, peanut butter fudge and a sweet gumminess.

The first impression Laphroaig leaves on the palate is a playful dance between the salty and sweet. You'll note impressions of sea spray and breakfast porridge on the finish, fading to that classic smoky peat for which Islay whiskies are known.

Like all Scotch whiskies, Laphroaig 10 Year is best enjoyed neat or with a little water added. It's also perfectly acceptable to drink on the rocks. Seriously, we won't judge. Feel free to experiment with cocktails like the Velvet Smoking Jacket, a perfectly smoky cocktail made with Laphroaig, Mezcal, Velvet Falernum and orange bitters. Shake with ice, strain and serve the cocktail neat with a simple lemon peel garnish.

‘Lore’ is a complex marriage of both classical Laphroaig styles and many ages of Laphroaig. The marriage draws from the peaty power of Laphroaig in the same vein as Quarter Cask but with the smoothness of double matured stock finished in European oak hogsheads. To add even further depth and complexity we used our most heavily peated whisky matured in ex-Laphroaig barrels along with some fully sherry matured casks.

Purchased from Maker's Mark Distillery in Kentucky, these give Laphroaig 18 Year a flavor unlike any other.
Laphroaig 18 Year gets its unique aroma and flavors from Islay, and this becomes apparent as soon as you open the bottle. You may think that inhaling a bunch of peat would smell like the compost heap you've put together over the years, but it's actually an intoxicating, earthy aroma that's highlighted by a hint of the sea. The American white oak then brightens the taste of the Scotch, offering flavors such as vanilla, spice, tobacco, sweet oak and leather. Bottled at 48 percent ABV, it's not too overwhelming to sip neat or with a single ice cube. Laphroaig 18 Year's quantities are limited, so make sure to grab one before it's too late.

Distilled since 1815, Laphroaig is the most famous Scotch whisky distillery from Islay Island, home to some of the best Scotch in the world. The key to the distinct smoky flavor and rich color comes straight from locally sourced elements, including the peat fields of the island, some of which are estimated at thousands of years old. Laphroaig uses this peat to dry the barley after it soaks in the local Kilbride Stream. This 17-hour process allows the Scotch to gather added smokiness and a taste that's unlike any other Scotch on the market."

It is a product of up to 40 different whiskies and is aged in either ex-bourbon or ex-sherry before being blended all together in oak casks to marry the whisky.    

Tasting Notes: The aroma initially shows a dark side to the whisky with rich, dark amber honey and lemon zest that has been lit and set in your cocktail. Oak is fairly pronounced as well. As you drink, however, those notes become brighter and sprightly. There's a mouthwatering aftertaste filled with dried fruit that entices you to go for another sip. This is a fairly easy and straight-forward blended whisky. If you're a fan of their standard bottling, this one is a nice step up.

They typically bring heavy rain, significant snowfall, and strong winds. These storms are similar to hurricanes, except they typically form over land rather than the ocean. When they gather strength along the East Coast, winds rotate in a counter-clockwise direction, generating a northeast wind around the North side of the storm. The origin of the name ‘Nor`easter’ comes from this wind direction.    The Nor’easter bourbon bottle flies a flag from International Maritime Signal Flags symbolizing the letter W (for whiskey). The same flag also signifies “requires medical assistance” (which translates to us as “in need of more whiskey”).    The climate and geography have a noticeable impact on the taste of the bourbon. The distillery’s proximity to the ocean and marine haze (Nantucket is nicknamed “The Grey Lady” ) add a touch of salinity to the bourbon.

Yet somehow it works, as its many awards would attest. Breckenridge Bourbon is an 86-proof blend that's out to take over the world from its mountainside craft distillery.

What goes into a bottle of Breckenridge Bourbon? This bourbon boasts a mash bill of 56 percent yellow corn, 38 percent green rye and 6 percent unmalted barley, but the secret ingredient is the pure snowmelt that trickles down through the Rockies. After fermentation, it's distilled in a copper pot still and aged for just two or three years.

What does Breckenridge Whiskey taste like? Think rye toast with honey, but in liquid form. Thanks to the high-rye mash bill, you're sure to notice the earthy, spicy rye, along with hints of banana and brown sugar. You'll also notice a touch of white pepper and toasted sesame. The long finish is sweet with a hint of oaky vanilla.

This is a bourbon you'll want to enjoy to the fullest, so skip most of the mixers. Sip this one neat or over ice. Or go for a classic bourbon drink like an Old Fashioned or a Mint Julep, both of which have the power to make great bourbon shine. Buy Breckenridge Bourbon online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in the store."

It chose to use specialty wine casks from Tuscany which previously held Sassicaia wine, into which the whisky was placed for 29 months.    This version was a sweet, sticky whisky that had the ability to hit the back of my throat with its sugariness on first sniff. There were notes of sticky toffee, pear, green apple and smoked cedar woodchips for me after that.    On the mouth, I picks up caramel and honey, before it shifted discreetly onto a touch of medicinal smoke before finishing off on sweet cigar smoke flavour and licorice.

For maturation, the Rye distillate is entered into the barrel at 103 proof, rather than a more industry standard higher proof. Barrel entry at a lower proof of 103 rather than a higher proof costs Michter's more money in terms of barrels and warehousing, but we believe it yields a richer, smoother, more full-bodied whiskey after proper maturation. A single barrel product, each barrel of Michter's US 1 Barrel Strength Kentucky Straight Rye is bottled at its particular alcohol level at the time of bottling.

Wiser, the founder of Wiser's Family of whiskies began the tradition of his Canadian whisky. Wiser's ambition for his distillery was simple - to produce the highest quality whisky ""that pleases the nose, tongue, and eye"".    In the hands of J.P. Wiser, this process was one that could not be sacrificed by rushing. According to J.P. Wiser, ""Quality is something you just can't rush. Horses should hurry, but whisky must take its time.""    Using only superior ingredients, he aged his whisky to distinction in premium white oak barrels. Over the years the tradition has been passed down, and even today, Wiser's whisky is the same whisky envisioned and developed by J.P. Wiser himself. It is still handmade using traditional methods to ensure that the final product still lives up to the standards set out by J.P. Wiser almost 150 years ago."

Without the means for traditional processing, alternative distilling practices were incorporated to give Canadian whisky its individual, characteristic flavor. Produced on the basis of cereal grains, the dominant, base ingredient is typically corn, with rye, wheat and barley being used as blending agents to produce a distinctive flavor. The actual recipe of a brand, in particular the portion of each of the cereal grains used, is what characterizes the whisky and sets it apart from its contemporaries. Canadian whisky also uses the unique process of clean heat, which eliminates the smoky flavor found in Scotch whisky. The vast majority of Canadian whisky is distilled in column or continuous stills to produce a very neutral, light product that is free of many of the congeners found in Bourbon and Scotch. The young whisky is then aged for a minimum of three years, in re-charred oak Bourbon barrels before the filtering and blending stages. Depending on the individual recipe, the flavoring whiskies used for blending may be produced in either pot or column stills, creating tastes that are both diverse and exceptional."

Founded in 1783 on the banks of the Ohio River, Evan Williams is one of the oldest distilleries in the country and the first bourbon distillery in Kentucky. Because of its history and secret recipe, Evan Williams Black Label is the premier Kentucky bourbon to suit your tastes.

As soon as you open a bottle of Evan Williams Black Label, you're met with a rich aroma of vanilla and mint, but this is just the precursor. When it hits your lips, hints of oak, caramel and brown sugar greet you and linger through the satisfying finish.

Although purists say the only way to drink bourbon is neat or on the rocks, Evan Williams Black Label lends itself to any number of lavish cocktails. Evan and cola is an all-American choice among cocktails, while an Evan and mineral water brightens the flavor without any harshness.

If you're into something that introduces more flavors, a classic mint julep or Manhattan transports you to the Kentucky Derby or the Big Apple, that is unless you already live in one of these cities. If not, experiment on your own with juices, sodas and mixers, and name it after your hometown. With any luck, a Des Moines Fury will catch on like wildfire. Evan Williams Black Label lets you show off your creativity behind the bar.

Buy Evan Williams Black online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store."

Our 91.6 proof whisky starts out with a mellow yet rich sweet, malty taste ending in an explosion of spice. Distilled by the sea on the shores of the Isle of Skye in Scotland, centuries of local distilling tradition and the rugged environment are what makes our award-winning malt so exquisite. Intense and powerful, the flavour comes from the peat burned during the malting process and the rich vanilla imbued by the aging process. With a lasting smooth aftertaste, savour this spirit's sweet and spicy flavours served neat, or draw them out with a little water.

Sitting amongst the Inner Hebridean Scottish Isles, Skye is rugged, windswept and a place of extremes. Our whisky captures the spirit of its island home perfectly. In 1825, Hugh MacAskill of Eigg acquired the Talisker House and along with his brother built what was to become one of the world’s most popular distilleries on the shore of Loch Harport.

The barley is lightly peated to approximately 18 phenol parts per million, which contributes a slightly smoky flavor profile to the whisky. Once the barley has been malted and peated, it is mashed using soft water drawn from one of the 14 underground springs that rise from Hawk Hill - Talisker has been using the same water source since it was founded nearly two centuries ago. ""I'm restless at heart so you'll find me poking my nose into the mash tun at all hours,"" says Mark Lochhead, Talisker's Distillery Manager.

After the barley has been mashed, it is fermented in the distillery's wooden washbacks before being twice distilled through Talisker's copper-pot stills. The stills are equipped with unique swan-shaped lye pipes and worm tubs. As a result of this configuration, a portion of the vapor during distillation condenses before reaching the cooler, and runs back into the still for redistillation.

This special release is the first ever to be finished in pot still Caribbean rum casks, enlivening Talisker's maritime, peppery character with the dark sweetness of warmer climes. It offers a sweet aroma of molasses balanced with sea salt and dried seaweed on a smoky barbecue base. Smooth and soft, this whisky's robust, salty-sweet taste is steadily outshined by the classic Talisker heat. The long, peppery and drying finish rounds off with sweet smoke. Bottled at natural cask strength, this extraordinary Talisker is best served in a traditional whisky glass with a little water to allow the finishing smoke to linger. Sitting amongst the Inner Hebridean Scottish Isles, Skye is rugged, windswept and a place of extremes. Our whisky captures the spirit of its island home perfectly. In 1825, Hugh MacAskill of Eigg acquired the Talisker House and along with his brother built what was to become one of the world’s most popular distilleries on the shore of Loch Harport. Now it is one of the oldest single malt Scotch whiskies made by the sea. Through fire, war and financial crises, this northern outpost has remained strong: producing consistently fine whiskies which, once tried, are rarely forgotten. Please drink responsibly."

The bourbon mash bill of 99 percent corn and 1 percent malted barley is very similar, if not identical, to that of what the Hamer family would have used while creating their whiskey. We feel this brand is an accurate representation of great Indiana whiskey."

It’s hard to believe at first that this is 35% alcohol / 70 proof. The honey is there in the opening but so, too, are the pear and apple notes, which are both quite strong. In the mid palate the grain from the whiskey begins to make its way through the sweet and fruit notes.  It’s when all these elements come together that Bushmills Irish Honey really works.

Our most popular whisky!  Roundstone Rye® is a very unique rye whisky, made completely from scratch at our distillery in Purcellville, Virginia.  This pre-Prohibition style rye whisky is made from 100% rye grain, sourced locally when available.  It is mashed, fermented, distilled and aged completely in our distillery, before bottling it at a very sippable 80 proof.  Aged it in new Minnesota white oak casks for a period of just under two years, the whisky is smooth, woody, with that true grain character achieved in a relatively young whisky. Roundstone Rye has a delicious woody taste, with notes of caramel, rich butter toffee, and just a hint of lemon in the nose.

Roundstone Rye is a superb sipping whisky, a great whisky in Manhattans, or your favorite rye whisky cocktails."

Our ""Distiller's Edition"" of our very popular Roundstone Rye.  Only one in every ten barrels gets selected to be in the Roundstone Rye ""92 Proof"" whisky.

This whisky is the culmination of several years of planning.  ""For a few years now, we've been putting whisky away for storage,"" remarked Becky Harris, Chief Distiller and President of Catoctin Creek Distilling Company.  ""We pulled some of the more interesting barrels from the back of the barn and decided to release these at a higher proof:  a whisky specially curated for flavor, while still being remarkably smooth, as is our existing 80 proof Roundstone."""

We start with traditional barreled rye whiskey aged 4 years, dump it out, and then further age it an additional 7 years in newly charred quarter cask oak barrels. Using a quarter cask ensures increased contact with the oak and more air breathed into the cask which means more flavor imparted to the liquid. This is not new, nor is it efficient; it’s just a very effective way to develop deep flavor.We blend this with our traditional rye whiskey, building out the spicy notes.

Established in 1823, the Mortlach distillery was the first legal distillery in Dufftown, and it has long continued to set the standard. To this day, this unique Speyside owes much to the brave vision of its greatest owners–George Cowie and his son Dr. Alexander Mitchell Cowie, who pioneered the complex '2.81 distillation' process.

The first component of Whipper Snapper is made from barley that is malted in the Pacific Northwest, and unmalted barely grown in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. The barely is ground, mashed, fermented, and distilled on location at the Ransom Distillery in Sheridan, Oregon. The second part is created by using a base of Kentucky corn whitedog, which is re-distilled in an alembic pot still. These concoctions are then aged in a variety of barrels, included used French coopered Pinot Noir barrels, new American coopered whiskey barrels, and used American whiskey barrels. For each bottling, eight barrels are specifically selected to make the best possible blend.

“THE WORST IS YET TO COME” 

was written on the death cards placed upon 

dead Nazis by the Devil’s Brigade. Officially 

known as the First Special Service Force, 

the Devil’s Brigade trained at Fort Harrison 

near Helena, Montana, and was comprised of 

Back-Country Rangers, Soldiers, Lumberjacks, 

Northwoodsmen, Hunters, Prospectors, 

Explorers, Game Wardens,  and Mountain Men 

who volunteered to join the secretive unit 

in 1942 during WWII. 

This joint American-Canadian commando unit 

was known for their stealth and skill with the 

V-42 dagger and had quickly gained the nickname 

“Black Devils” and a reputation for their fierce 

style of fighting at night in blackened faces. 


Made of 60% American Bourbon 

and 40% Canadian Whisky just like

the percentage of men assigned to the Unit, 

this blend of whiskies is our way of honoring 

the bravery and valor of these men who 

fought in World War II with distinction.

The legacy continues with current

American and Canadian Special Operations 

Forces who trace their lineage and heritage

to the “Forcemen.”

A portion of the proceeds is donated to the 

Special Forces Association Chapter XXVIII

2146,5522,Oban 14 Year Single Malt,Scotland,Oban,"Scotch Whisky, Whiskey",,43%,,14.0,4.8,34,$91.99,,"Crafted from one of the oldest and most legendary distilleries in Scotland, Oban 14 Year Single Malt is expertly aged in the traditional fashion. Thanks to founders John and Hugh Stevenson setting up their brewery — and ultimately the Oban Distillery — in the 1790s, the once-sleepy port city of Oban became a bustling seaside resort in the West Highlands.

The distillery remained in the family for nearly a century before J. Walter Higgin purchased and renovated it. Now, more than 100 years later, the Oban Distillery remains essentially unchanged since Higgin's refurbishment. You simply won't find a more authentic Scotch whisky than Oban.

Oban 14 Year Single Malt is crafted with 100-percent barley to the distillery's exact specifications, which includes fermenting the malted barley in small-batch, lantern-shaped copper stills before aging the scotch in oak casks. During its rest, the whisky is shaped by the surrounding environment, which consists of warm, salty Gulf Stream air and a temperate climate. The result is a full-bodied, extremely dry scotch with notes of honey and dried figs, which lead to a soft, oaky finish.

Wondering how you should drink Oban 14 Year Single Malt? Enjoy it neat or on the rocks. The drink has a sweet, rich aroma with hints of citrus, pears, seaweed, ropes and sea salt with a slight peatiness. The long finish culminates with dry oak and fruit. You can also add a drop of water and swirl it around to note its oily characteristics and bring out the smoothness.

There’s a solid balance between the rich and spicy characteristics. The entry is very flavorful and expressive, matching the nose quite well with toasted malt, green apple, dried apricot, salt, chocolate, and orange peel. In the midpalate the real impact of the small cask finish is quite apparent as the spice elements noticeably increase with clove and oak without abandoning the sweet dried fruit underneath. After the peak of the midpalate, Oban Little Bay backs off quite a bit for a lightly acidic and slightly spicy finish. It’s a fairly light and slightly dry finish that ends fairly clean."

Tasting Notes:
Aromas of lanolin, almond, creamed corn and toasty vanilla. The mid-palate flavor is heavily wheated, layered and moderately sweet. Long, oaky, and intensely smooth finish.

“The Road Home” batch pays tribute to my grandfather as the name Little Book is actually the childhood nickname that he gave me. And so I thought after having a couple of chapters under my belt that it would be a great time to pay honor to him and blend some of the liquids that he gave the bourbon industry. The four liquids that I chose to go into this batch of Little Book® are from the original small batch collection that my grandfather, Booker, created. The Road Home is a blend of nine year old Basil Hayden®, nine year old Knob Creek®, 11 year old Booker’s® and 12 year old Baker’s®, and as always with Little Book®, these liquids are at barrel strength and will be bottled at barrel strength as well. The name “The Road Home” references the road that I travel to and from on a regular basis, the same road my grandfather, Booker, traveled back when he used to work here at the distillery. I tinkered with a lot of different recipes, 57 to be exact, before finding what I was looking for – layers of vanilla, char and dried apricots with lingering oak. The final recipe I selected was 51 of the 57 I tried – a lot more trial and error than the others, but I thought if someone is going to play with the liquids that my grandfather developed, they had better produce a damned good blend. - Freddie Noe, 8th Generation Beam Family Distiller"

For this project we partnered with our friends at Trubee Honey. They are a fantastic local artisan honey producer dedicated to doing things the right way. We started out by giving Trubee freshly dumped ""honey barrels"" (traditional meaning) that had aged 11 year old Belle Meade Single Barrel Bourbon. They then filled the barrels with local wildflower honey and allowed it to age in the barrel to produce their Barrel Aged Honey. They then emptied these now, quite literal, ""honey barrels"" and gave them back to us. We then refilled the barrels with our signature high rye blend of Bourbon. 

The resulting Bourbon, flavored with real honey in ""honey barrels"", tastes like no other honey whiskey on the market. The bold and deliciously rich nature of this cask strength Bourbon makes it perfect for sipping neat, on the rocks, or for making a high proof classic cocktail."

As Iowa’s first micro-distillery, we’re used to being on the leading edge. On July 1st, 2010 we launched Iowa’s first bourbon since the Prohibition era. Made from nearly 75% corn, Cedar Ridge Bourbon Whiskey is crafted in small batches for a high-quality, smooth, premium bourbon that is receiving rave reviews at tasting events across the country and selling off the shelves. Awards include “Best of Category” for the Clearheart Vodka and “Gold Medal” for the Dark Rum from the Los Angeles International Wine and Spirits Competition and a 92 point “Exceptional” rating for the Bourbon from the Beverage Testing Institute in Chicago."
2493,6613,Cedar Ridge Single Malt,United States,Cedar Ridge,"Bourbon, Whiskey",,49%,,,5.0,1,$49.99,,"Cedar Ridge Single Malt Whiskey was first release from a mere 4 barrels and they say that each barrel has its own signature flavor (a notion we support knowing that master distillers spend a lot of time blending whiskey from different barrels to achieve a consistent product). The website goes so far as to offer different tasting notes for each barrel--each of the 4 began life in a 15 gallon (quite small) ex-bourbon barrel. Following, the four were given a separate finish in one of rum, sherry, port, and bourbon barrels. The first 3 barrels were made with 2-row barley and the last a peated barley malt (which we guess will give it a smokier, scotch-like profile).     Special note: one could deem each of these separate expressions but given the small release and difficulty in assigning ratings to a given label, we have combined the release into this one entry. From the image, we believe that Barrel #1 (2-row barley grain and a finish in port barrel) was supplied to the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.     Cedar Ridge Winery and Distillery lays claim to the first legal distillery operating in Iowa.They craft spirits using products primarily from their own vineyard and distill from scratch in traditional Bavarian copper pot stills."

At the Cotton Club, when patrons ordered a “Chicken Cock,” waiters would present the tin can tableside and ceremoniously open it to reveal the bottle of Chicken Cock Whiskey inside. Duke Ellington writes about Chicken Cock in his memoirs, referring to the “brand that was served in a tin can.” At a rumored $15 per bottle Chicken Cock wasn’t for the light of pocket, but it was a small price to pay to secure a prime table near some of the greatest musicians of the era.

It is thus with great pride that we have the honor to reintroduce to the world this once famous (and we hope soon to be famous again) brand, paying homage to its great history while embracing the future with a bold new look and flavor.

Through countless samplings, we determined the “perfect proof” at 104-proof, with just a slight amount of pure water to open up the amazing flavors, and non-chilled filtered to retain the rich amber colors and exquisite taste profile.

Hibiki is the culmination of the Japanese art of blending and expert craftsmanship, with a healthy heaping of luxury thrown in for good measure. The brand was launched in 1989 to celebrate the brand Suntory's 90th birthday, and it's become Japan's most highly awarded blended whisky of all time. More than that, Hibiki takes the honor of being among the most prestigious whiskies the world over.

Hibiki Japanese Harmony Whisky is both delicate and luminous with a wonderful complexity. The amber-colored liquid smells of rosemary, rose, lychee and sandalwood, paving the way for a honey-like sweetness with notes of white chocolate and candied orange peel. As for the finish, Hibiki Japanese Haromy is subtle with a hint of Japanese oak, which lingers on the palate.

It’s best enjoyed neat, on the rocks or with a bit of water added. Japanese whisky pairs remarkably well with Japanese food, so don't be afraid to drink it with sashimi, sushi or a strong fermented fish. It also makes a wonderful cocktail, such as the Sokaiya, which consists of Hibiki, bitter Sencha green tea and ginger liqueur.

The name “McNish” was the correct spelling of the family name and was only altered to Macnish for ease of pronunciation in all corners of the world. The McNish clan is a sept of the Clan MacGregor. A sept means a clan in the sense that the members of it belong to a branch of a race or family and as such have the right to wear the tartan, etc, of this clan. The clan motto “Forti Nihil Dificile” which means “To the strong nothing is difficult” encapsulates the spirit of the McNish family.

People said he couldn't go straight, that such a disreputable liquor could never be mainstream, but Smith's disregard for authority only urged him to make his old-fashioned moonshine legal. And honestly, we couldn't be more thankful, as this stuff is the real deal!

Climax Moonshine is crafted from corn, rye and barley malt mash. The result is a clean, natural-tasting alcoholic beverage with a subtle sweetness that boldly defies convention. One of the best ways to enjoy Climax Moonshine is decidedly Southern — simply mix the alcohol with sweet tea for a no-fuss cocktail everyone can enjoy. For a peach-flavored tea, add peach bitters and some peach slices. And if you want a more traditional mixer, blend Climax Moonshine with agave nectar, mint leaves, watermelon cubes, ice and a mix of lemonade and Sprite. Trust us, there's nothing more refreshing on a hot summer's day than rocking on your front porch sipping a watermelon ""moonito.""

Unique Ingredients- 4 times more Barley (barley gives our bourbon its unique toasty, chocolate, and cereal notes).
Slow Proofed, no shortcuts- Cut over weeks not days


WHAT MAKES US DIFFERENT?
MASTER DISTILLER
Greg Metze has over 40 years of distilling experience, 14 of which were spent as the master distiller for MGP. - a total tenure of 28 years under one roof. He was the last Master Distiller to carry the torch of the acclaimed Seagram’s Distillery Apprentice Program. During that period the US went through a resurgence in the brown spirits category and his name is likely behind many of the whiskeys you see on your shelf today.

INGREDIENTS
Old Elk Bourbon is crafted using 4x more malted barley than conventional bourbon recipes.
Why? Because of this higher proportion of malted barley in the mashbill, we are attracting people who are a-typical bourbon drinkers. The 4x more malted barley produces a product (bourbon) that’s smooth and easy to drink which attracts those new to the category, but also provides enough complexity and a sense of familiarity to whisk(e)y consumers who may enjoy scotch. As a result, our bourbon is appreciated by all connoisseurs of whiskey (expertly crafted spirits).

SLOW CUT™ PROOFING
All bourbon is taken out of the barrel at cask strength. It’s then proofed with water. Traditionally, this process takes 24-48 hours. However, we choose to do it for significantly longer at very small increments.
Why? When you add water to alcohol, heat is generated. At a distillery scale, it’s hundreds of gallons at a time – which creates enough heat to literally boil off some of the lighter, finer flavors! Our choice is to extend the life of the proofing time by adding the same total amount of fresh Colorado mountain water over multiple weeks (instead of days) to keep the bourbon cool, allowing us to bottle every last drop of of flavor."

With this masterpiece, Greg applied many techniques he acquired through his hands-on experience distilling over 280 million bottles of rye. Not one to shy away from a challenge, he asked himself, what would happen if he applied the techniques he's learned and used them with a new ingredient: wheat? The proof is in the liquid, literally and figuratively.

The distillery is currently the only Highland producer using a fully peated standard malt, which lends a character unexpected from whiskies of this region. They utilize labor-intensive Oregon pine fermentation vessels, which impart depth to the final spirit. Finally, after maturation in standard oak casks, it undergoes a second aging in much smaller quarter casks; these were common a century ago, but have largely faded into history. Finally, unlike many larger brands, Ardmore is bottled without the use of chill filtration. While this means the spirit may turn cloudy in cold weather or with the addition of water, it preserves the natural flavors and oils from the grain. This all results in a distinctive whisky of delightful complexity. The nose is dry, smoky, earthy, and malty, with just a hint of berry fruit. The palate, however, displays rich peat, toffee, cedar, candied orange, and spice. The addition of a splash of cold water enhances the aromatics and flavor."

At the age of sixteen, he started work in the Distillery as an office boy and fast became a leading pioneer in the development of bourbon. From the time he was made company president in 1921 until his retirement in 1952, his Distillery expanded from 44 to 144 buildings to become the largest Distillery of its day. During that period Colonel Blanton created his very special and limited supply of bourbon - his private reserve - handpicked and stored in what now is known as the famous Warehouse H. Although Colonel Blanton died in the spring of 1959, his legacy lives. Introduced in 1984, Blanton’s namesake bourbon was the first ever Single Barrel Bourbon sold commercially. The Single Barrel Bourbon is the first of its kind.

Blanton's is the Original Single Barrel Bourbon that retains its uniqueness today by virtue of world wide critical acclaim. It has been awarded international gold medals, grand gold medals, and recommendations from noted spirits writers like Paul Pacult. The individual barrel selection process is one that involves one of the most respected Master Distillers in the bourbon industry. Elmer T. Lee introduced Blanton's Single Barrel Bourbon in 1984 and since that time has been enshrined in the Master Distillers' Hall of Fame. Elmer searched the honey spots of Warehouse H to personally select those barrels destined for greatness. Unlike other brands which are restricted to certain ages, Blanton's strives for a distinctive flavor profile across an array of years. The typical bourbon used is approximately eight years old, however, it is not unusual for the age to extend to ten or twelve years. From world-class bourbon to the most unique package, everything about Blanton's exudes quality, class, and excellence.

To ensure a unique and consistent flavor, barrels are hand selected to create a perfect blend that is smooth and at the same time bold and intense."
2943,7685,Smoke Wagon Uncut Unfiltered Whiskey,United States,Nevada HG Distilling Co.,"Bourbon, Whiskey",,,,,5.0,1,$73.67,,"No Water Added Because None is Needed

We took the same vintage blending philosophy that we used to create Small Batch, except this time the goal was to create high proof bourbon that tasted its best neat. Uncut is so rich and sweet with an unbelievably thick mouth feel, the heat and rye spice finish are a welcome addition. It's like milk with cookies!

Blending vintages of our high rye mash bill to achieve this flavor profile at 115-116 plus proof was a very rewarding challenge for us. There is a delicate balance between creamy mouthfeel, tannins and sugars that comes into play that makes the end result magical. Older vintages have more evaporation which means a higher concentration of fats and sugars per ounce which gives them that nice creamy mouthfeel as well as caramel and honey goodness. But they also have more tannins because alcohol has been in contact with the wood for longer. A lot of what is perceived as alcohol burn is actually a harshness due to tannins. This can counterbalance the benefit gained by a creamy mouthfeel insulating your pallet from alcohol heat. So there needs to be enough of the significant older bourbon for the oak flavors and mouthfeel, but also some younger ones to cut back on the tannins and bring in some delicate fruit and caramel flavors. The youngest used is 4 year which is where all the rye spice comes from. 

Calling out flavors for Uncut is hard to do because it is truly mercurial. Here's a story to illustrate what we mean. We blended to taste and bottled a batch at the end of fall when the distillery was 72 degrees. A few months later in the winter we did a tasting with some beverage directors and mixologists when the building was 58. We told them what to expect as far as flavors and that was not what anyone experienced. They were saying they tasted cola and cherries with virtually no rye spice. Our initial thought was how did these people get their jobs, cola and cherries?!?! Upon sampling they were right! I'm sure you can guess what happened when we sampled that same bottle at room temperature again, the flavor profile changed back to what it was when we first blended it.

2944,7686,Smoke Wagon Straight Bourbon Whiskey,United States,Nevada HG Distilling Co.,"Bourbon, Whiskey",,,,,5.0,1,$32.99,,"Just released in fall of 2019, the goal was to create an affordable everyday bourbon that had that unique and unmistakeable Smoke Wagon Flavor, consisting of delicate sweet notes with a rye spice finish. Barrels with our same high rye mash bill were racked on the top two floors of the warehouse and never rotated. The higher the floor the hotter it gets in the summer causing more expansion and more movement into the wood. This as well being non chill filtered creates a bourbon that is rich and creamy beyond its years. Never rotating the barrels ensures there are no harsh tannin flavors and the high rye mash bill adds a delightful spicy and nutty finish."

Named after turquoise, the Nevada state semi precious stone (also called Jewel of the Desert) and like turquoise, this bourbon is rare and there is only a limited amount. 

We don't believe in rotating barrels. We feel Bourbon is aged best with the barrel racked on its side, and undisturbed. Every time a barrel is rolled around, it breaks char off of the staves. If too much char is floating in the bourbon it can undue the delicate balance of flavors and become too oak heavy. Having barrels rest on their sides ensures that bourbon passes equally  through the char, the toasted layer of oak and the raw wood.

After 10 years on the fourth floor (the top half of the warehouse) we felt this bourbon was aged to perfection, so the 35 barrels on that floor were pulled and Desert Jewel was created.

Nose: Dark Fruit, cinnamon vanilla and oak.

Taste: Initial honey/caramel on the front of the tongue cocoa, rye spice, cinnamon and oak on the pallet. Creamy mouth feel finishing with oak and rye spice notes of white pepper."
2946,7689,St. Augustine Florida Double Cask Bourbon,United States,St. Augustine Distillery,"Bourbon, Whiskey",,46.9%,,,5.0,1,$49.99,,"Because there was so much agricultural heritage in Florida, Philip McDaniel and Mike Diaz wanted to make their bourbon there. Not only did they want to make their bourbon in Florida, they wanted to make it in St Augustine, The Nation’s Oldest City. They discovered an abandoned ice plant (the oldest in Florida) and commenced to restore that building to its historic splendor. While Phil and Mike were convinced that Florida’s heat and humidity and St Augustine’s maritime climate would make spectacular bourbon, they were businessmen, not distillers. Never satisfied with “good enough,” they set out to hire the best experts they could to assist in their dream. The team hired Dave Pickerell, former Master Distiller at Maker’s Mark, to consult on the distillery design and processes. Jake Norris, former Founding Distiller for Stranahan’s Colorado Whiskey, developed the mash bill for the bourbon. Brendan Wheatley distilled the spirit and developed our barrel program. Dave Pickerell returned to lead the team’s final blending of this first bourbon release.

St. Augustine Distillery is proud to present Florida Double Cask Bourbon. This bourbon is made from a mash bill of 60% regional corn, 22% malted barley and 18% regional wheat. The grains are milled and mashed on site, and fermented with proprietary yeast strains in closed-top fermenters. The mash is distilled in a Vendome 750-gallon stripping still, and the spent grains are sent to local farmers for cattle feed – eliminating any waste from the process. The resulting low wines are then distilled to final proof in a Vendome 550-gallon spirit still. The Double Cask Bourbon was barreled at 125 proof in 25-gallon, new oak barrels using several different char profiles. Due to Florida’s heat and humidity, the decision was made to move a portion of the spirit into 53-gallon barrels to continue aging while preventing over-extraction. This first release is a combination of barrels ranging from 16 to 28 months of age. To really round out the spirit, the team decided to finish 7% of the spirit in port barrels. The resulting blend is round, fruity and well-balanced. After extensive bench trialing, the bourbon was bottled at 93.8 proof to best present the spirit’s true flavor.

The resulting malted bourbon achieves the team’s goal – it is approachable, full-flavored sipping bourbon. The corn provides the traditional bourbon sweetness while the relatively high barley content adds chocolate and malty notes. The wheat adds creaminess and mouth feel while allowing the sweetness of the corn and vanilla to show through. This dark amber spirit has a deep, warm nose with notes of caramel, dark fruit, oak and dark chocolate. The taste is full-bodied, deep and complex with spice at first, followed by toffee and dark winter fruit. The lingering finish is warm, pleasant and full of caramel and dark chocolate.

The beautiful bottle highlights the historic structure in which the spirit was distilled and bottled. Enjoy this first step in St Augustine Distillery’s journey to produce spectacular bourbon in Florida."

The company's first release was crafted by Charbay Master Distiller Marko Karakasevic. Thirty years ago, Karakasevic — a 12th generation Master Distiller — emigrated to California and became a pioneer in the American craft spirits movement by opening the doors to one of the first craft distilleries in the United States. Over three decades later, Karakasevic continues to release some of the most unique and interesting spirits in the world.

Amador Ten Barrels Straight Hop-Flavored Whiskey is made from a marriage of 60% straight malt whiskey and 40% hop-flavored whiskey. The hop-flavored whiskey is crafted from Racer 5 IPA, a craft beer brewed by the Bear Republic Brewery. The IPA is full-bodied, and contributes a malty hoppiness to the whiskey without overwhelming the whiskey's flavor profile.

After the straight malt whiskey and hop- flavored whiskey are distilled, they are matured separately for over two years in French oak wine barrels. Then, the whiskies are ""married in our family chardonnay barrels for another year before being bottled,"" says Karakasevic.

The whiskey has an aroma of caramel, cloves and vanilla. Notes of hop-spices, two-row barley, toffee, butterscotch, rich citrus, orange, warm caramel and nougat dominate the palate and lead to a long, ever-lasting finish.

Only ten barrels of this whiskey will ever be made."

Because the “Port” casks came from our own winery, they were filled with whiskey within 24 hours of the wine being removed.

3056,8426,Copper Fox Wasmund’s Single Malt Whiskey,United States,Copper Fox,"Single Malt Whiskey, Whiskey",,48%,,,5.0,1,$43.99,,"There is nothing as wonderful as new innovation! Here is the skinny from Rick Wasmund: ""The foundation of our product is Thoroughbred barley from our own private grower and used by no other distillery. We malt our own, in small batches, using a traditional floor malting the way it's been done for centuries in Scotland. When the malt is ready to be dried, we don't use peat! Instead we use the smoke of an apple wood, cherry wood and oak wood fire that is kept at a slow burn for a night and a day. This is another first for single malt whisky that adds to the cascade of finishing flavors. When the malt is ready, it is milled here and mixed with hot water to make a sweet smoky mash that is pumped over to the fermenter where yeast is added and it is fermented out to a distiller's beer. The beer goes through our double pot still and comes out in one-barrel batches. It is said that the smaller the still the better the whisky, by that standard this may well be the best whisky on the market today! The next step is our secret chip and barrel aging process (patent pending). We can only tell you that it involves apple wood, cherry wood and oak chips, special selection and toasting techniques, and more time and passion than could be expected from a larger operation."

However, the Japanese have created a cult following thanks to spirits like Hakashu 12 Year. Distilled in the guise of a Scotland-based distillery, this handcrafted drink leaves little to be desired.

As soon as you uncork a bottle of this masterpiece, you've unleashed an amalgam of toasted barley, almonds and even a bit of char. That said, the crisp taste hits your lips with a grassy, herby, smoky blend that's nothing short of phenomenal. The aging process makes these flavors even more pronounced. If you've never tried a Japanese whisky, you should probably start here. 

Purists, rejoice! Hakashu 12 Year Single Malt Whisky is most prominent in flavor if it's taken on the rocks or neat. This allows all the notes and flavors to reach their height right in your grill. Add a splash of water if it's too much. You won't separate yourself from flavor country.

If throwing an ice cube into a rocks glass isn't your ideal whisky drink, don't fret. There are more than enough mixers and cocktails to get you ready for the party. Hakashu blends wonderfully with cola, providing a sweetness that's not too sweet, yet not too bold. For anyone else that's a bit sheepish, you can doll it up with some lemon juice. Known as the whisky sour, you won't find a sour note as you sip away.

The libation became known as the “Sazerac” and America’s first branded cocktail was born. This is the whiskey that started it all. Today, Sazerac Rye is the most awarded rye whiskey since 2005. 

Sazerac Rye has the perfect balance of sweetness and spice; in part because of the unique recipe and rye used, and in part because of the thorough distillation process done at Buffalo Trace Distillery.

“Any crispier and the glass would shatter…a rare and valuable gem!” -Jim Murray

""Versatile, crisp, and an ideal match for cocktails that also include orange liqueur, as well as its namesake classic cocktail.  Light aromas include vanilla and a touch of juicy citrus.  Flavors run to bitter orange, dark chocolate and black tea, finishing with a pepper tingle.  Velvety feel, despite the brisk alcohol."" Wine Enthusiast, July 2013"

This straight rye has a mellow spice and dry sweetness that dances on the tongue, giving pure delight that is worthy of the Sazerac name.

Very mature, with notes of oak, leather molasses and all-spice. The long, warm finish is preceded by notes of mint, eucalyptus, cinnamon, vanilla, and lingering pepper.

Spicer and more robust than malt whisky, rye was so popular that George Washington distilled it at his estate in Mount Vernon. As distilleries across the country were forced to close their doors due to Prohibition, however, bootleggers began distilling gin instead of rye, and for good reason ""“ gin didn't require aging under the watchful eye of a master distiller and its true flavors could be hidden behind a mask of botanicals. As Americans grew accustomed to gin, rye whiskey became an anachronism.    Nearly a century after Prohibition, the preferred whiskey of the saloon era is experiencing a resurgence. By law, rye whiskey must be made from a mash of at least 51% rye. Rye that has been aged in charred, new oak barrels for at least two years earns the title straight rye whiskey."

JD didn’t just move to Nicaragua, he actually lived inside the factory for 15 years. Now, that’s hard core …!  It was during those formidable years, deep in the northern mountains of Nicaragua where JD cut his teeth at craft production, making the hand made premium cigars that truly changed the industry.  Best known for “Market Disruption” before the word was an art form. JD was the ORIGINAL DISRUPTER. The irreverent… the radiant … the straight out maverick who wrote the book, religion bent to “Destroy & Rebuild” everything in his path. And that’s real talk. Ask your neighbor.  Awarded with pioneering new market segments in the premium cigar industry with brands such as ACID Cigars, Liga Privada, and Kentucky Fire Cured, his dream was to venture deeper into his artisan core and push the limits in craft spirits, beer, and even food.  And so the story of JOHN DREW begins… a journey filled with pain and joy, all things craft, and an army of random folk who became his family throughout the years.

A number of stories relate to a stunningly beautiful lake close to the Vee called Bay Lough.

‘ Knockmealdowns’ is one of the Tipperary Boutique Distillery’s new ‘Mountain Range’ – a series of older whiskies celebrating the land in County Tipperary. ‘Knockmealdowns’ is created from only six casks and matured in Ireland for 10 years in ex-bourbon barrels. The whiskey is cut to 47% with water from Ballindoney Farm. The nose opens with fresh oak, developing into hot caramel sauce with notes of chocolate and vanilla. The pallet is light and smooth – sweet honey cut through with citrus notes, then becoming savoury and peppery. The finish lingers, oaky with drying tannins and just a touch of ginger spice.

Abraham's face adorns the bottle to this day. Rye whiskey reigned supreme in pre-prohibition America and Overholt was always considered one of the best. It was thanks to one of its shareholders and eventual owners, Secretary of the Treasury Andrew Mellon that the distillery was able to acquire a license to continue selling whiskey during the dark days. The long slow decline of American rye whiskey didn't even stop the brand, which was eventually sold to Jim Beam in 1987. Production was moved from West Overton, Pennsylvania to Frankfort, KY and slowly the brand transitioned away from the 100 proof BIB designation. Modern Overholt is a two year old 80 proof product, a shadow over what it once was, but a solid work horse no doubt. The renewed demand for rye and a consistent interest in high proof spirits has encourage Beam to reaffirm Old Overholt's age old committment to quality. The result is an exceptionally well priced revision of an old classic, Bonded as it ought to be. Modern Overholt has always been a value play and the quality increase has pushed it to the top of the pile on those terms. It'll be hard to find a better rye for your dollar.

“Henry DuYore’s Rye Whiskey speaks to our aspiration to release spirits that balance the character of their grains of origin with the influence of the years passed in oak barrels. An abiding fondness for the flavor of rye inspired us to produce our own bottling. With this Rye Whiskey, we sought to temper the admirable innate feistiness of rye with the rich, supple flavor of malted barley. Rye proved to be a worthy adversary for the old-fashioned Ransom mashing system, which we originally designed for the more cooperative malted barley. The texture of the rye grain made it impossible to push our house-mashed base wort above fifty percent rye, so we selected a well-made rye white dog to bring the rye to the forefront of our blend. We feel that the resulting whiskey retains the texture, aromatics, and flavor of an artisan pot distilled spirit. We are proud to offer up this whiskey as a fitting tribute to the legendary old moonshiner Henry DuYore. Although he is now completely reformed, Henry’s true identity cannot be revealed. You might find him in his cabin, whittling, reading classic literature, or enjoying the occasional nip of good whiskey…or you might even find him right around here.” Distillery Notes

Lush toffee sweetness and dark chocolate with hints of vanilla, fudge, nougat and molasses. Underlying notes of dates, tobacco, dark berries, spearmint and a hint of coffee round out the palate.

Infusion Diabolique Kentucky uses a 4yr old Kentucky bourbon as its base and then infused with ""Black Mission figs,"" vanilla, cinnamon, and a blend of unnamed herbs and spices. They use no added sugar and any sweetness is attributed to the fruit used in the infusion (presumably the figs). According to the write-up at the Massachusetts' Beverage Business, the flavor was inspired by executive chef Robert Fathman of the Lenox Hotel in Boston who served extra figs with a pour of bourbon and spices. He continued experimenting until he met soon-to-be partner Brandon Bach to market the spirits.Together, they operate under the name of Black Squirrel Enterprises. They contract with MS Walker to acquire the base spirit and bottle the product.

We at Cockpit are left wondering why much of the distilling world has not caught on, and continues to use the same old, same old, as far as ingredients and techniques to create spirits has gone? The corn we use in our P-51 Bourbon whiskey is a food grade, pre-converted, steam flaked corn. The corn has been degermed (the oil removed), thus eliminating rancidity, therefore leading to an extremely crisp, clean profile not seen elsewhere in a whiskey coming straight out of the still. The corn costs us about twenty times as much as the feed grade corn the majority of most other distilleries use. However, it’s worth it! The grain bill consists of only about 54% corn making it our “Barely Bourbon” (most other Bourbon mashes consist of about 70-80% corn on the mash bill), we then add German rye, crystal, and chocolate malt from England, American base malt, and American Winter Wheat.  We discovered this corn and unique grain bill provides us with a much cleaner spirit featuring a smoother, more complex finish, straight out of the still. Then we barrel the whiskey in Woodruff Reserve Double oak barrel with two sets of medium plus toasted oak spirals thus rendering this spirit with three barrels worth of surface area. The lighter toast gives this spirit a lighter color and a unique tasting profile with notes of fruit such as apple and citrus."

AMERICAN WHISKEY RE-MASTERED BY DAVE PICKERELL X METALLICA.

BLACKENED™ is the new super-premium whiskey collaboration from Master Distiller Dave Pickerell and Metallica. A blend of hand-selected, well-aged bourbons & ryes, uniquely finished in black brandy casks and the earth shattering music of Metallica.

Using our proprietary BlackNoise™ finishing process, each batch of whiskey is blasted with its very own Metallica playlist, selected and arranged by the band themselves. The low frequency sound waves force the whiskey to penetrate deeper into the barrel, extracting more caramel, honey and vanilla flavors from the wood. The result is a magnificently balanced whiskey, robust in flavor and ideal for sipping neat, on the rocks, or in a classic cocktail.

3623,10895,Little Book Chapter 2 Noe Simple Task Whiskey,United States,Little Book,"American Whiskey, Whiskey",,,,,5.0,1,$119.99,,"As the name implies, this round of Little Book was a long journey that really tested my skills as a blender. Maybe I jinxed myself naming my first batch “the Easy.” Superstitions aside, I spent a lot of time in the lab on this one. I tried almost forty different recipes. But in the end, all that hard work paid off and we landed on a one-of-a-kind whiskey I’m really proud of.


The road to Noe Simple Task started when I visited our Canadian distilleries in early 2017. I enjoy travelling to different places in the world to see how they distill their spirits. There, I was able to taste some great Canadian whisky straight out of the barrel. I was really drawn to the fruit and floral notes they achieve. I wanted to know more.


Later in the year I went back for a deeper dive to learn all about their process. And taste some more great whisky. This was a step outside my comfort zone. The rules and laws for making whiskey in Kentucky that I grew up with don’t apply up there. But I came back inspired and began blending.


Now, while the flavors of the Canadian whisky had piqued my interest, my heart still lies in Kentucky. So I was excited about the idea of bringing the best of both worlds together. Knowing I wanted to blend with Kentucky Straight Rye, I started experimenting with different Canadian whiskies, trying to pull in those fruity and floral notes. They use a lot of different barrels to age up there, so I was able to play around with a lot of different flavors. I was looking for something that would round out the blend and really showcase the nuances of both the American and Canadian whiskies. In the end, I found the 40-year-old whisky and 13-year-old rye helped me achieve exactly what I wanted—a truly balanced and refined whiskey with a nice, lingering finish that’s full of flavor."

3648,10920,John Emerald Alabama Single Malt Whiskey,United States,John Emerald Distilling Co.,"American Whiskey, Whiskey",,,,,5.0,1,$47.87,,"It’s not Scotch and it’s not Bourbon.  So what is it?  Well, the Federal Government says it is a “Malt Whisky” and defines it as follows: “Whisky produced at not exceeding 80% alcohol by volume (160 proof) from a fermented mash of not less than 51 percent malted barley and stored at not more than 62.5% alcohol by volume (125 proof) in charred new oak containers.”

What’s the difference between Whisky and Whiskey?  Answer: Absolutely nothing.  The grammar police would say Whisky is of Scottish origin and Whiskey with an “e” is of Irish or American origin.  So we use whiskey with an “e” even though our family hailed from Scotland a long, long time ago and that would technically mean everything we create is of Scottish origin.  But, as our revolutionary forefathers figured out we are American’s and more precisely we and Alabama Americans.  So our whiskey holds the “e”.

Throughout our recipe development we strive to use as much American and Alabama products as possible.  With that in mind we made our first test batch of whiskey with American distillers malted barley.  I can report that we now have 5 cases of the most God awful whiskey ever made.  You see, the variety of American distillers malted barley we used was never designed to stand alone as it was specifically grown to be an adjunct to corn based whiskey providing the enzyme activity of converting starch to sugar.

With our head first jump into malt whiskey our palettes quickly convinced us a search for a better distiller’s malted barley was needed.  Ironically we found the best malt for John’s Alabama Single Malt in Ireland.  I guess that further justifies the “e”.  

So with our barley found, we began making whiskey.  Just throwing malted barley in the mash tun (the vessel where starch in the grain is converted to sugar) was not going to be good enough.  We needed a Southern flavor.  To that end we began smoking a portion of our grain recipe with Peach and Pecan wood.  Not a whole lot different than you smoking a rack of baby back ribs in you backyard."

James Worts and his brother-in-law, William Gooderham became successful millers after their arrival to Canada from the UK. A distillery was later added as wheat production began to increase in Upper Canada. Distillation was an efficient way to preserve excess grain that was prone to spoilage, as well as dispose of the grain middlings left over from the milling process. After taking out a patent for a “Riley still”, Gooderham & Worts would fundamentally change distilling in Canada by double distilling whisky through 2 columns making a softer whisky than what was available at the time. By the late 1800’s Toronto’s Gooderham & Worts distillery was the largest in the world. Under the guidance of Doctor Don Livermore, a new Gooderham & Worts Four Grain whisky was launched as a tribute to the original recipe from 1832.

It is a premium blend of four diverse grains – corn, wheat, barley and rye. All four grains are distilled and aged separately before blended, comprised of pot and column distilled wheat, barley and rye, and double column distilled corn. 100% locally sourced grain from Ontario Canada, aged in a combination of new virgin oak casks and used Bourbon casks. Distilled true to the tradition started Gooderham & Worts started in 1832."

Of well-known single malts from Scotland, it resembles the Lagavulin whisky. It is very peat-y. Made from 100% peat-malted barley brought in from Scotland, our whiskey would be a single malt Scotch if Oregon were Scotland. We distill in our Holstein pot stills using one pass distillation, but make a small “heads” cut and a fairly large “tails” cut and put about 4 liters of tails into the next still run. The proof at time of distillation is about 150 (75% abv). Then we reduce in proof and barrel-age the rough distillate in barrels made from air-dried Oregon Oak. The present bottling is aged 3 year but we think it is remarkably smooth for such a young whiskey. The result is a smooth, peat-y whiskey with a surprisingly clean finish. Production is very limited because what we put in the barrel doesn’t come out for years.    McCarthy’s Oregon Single Malt Whiskey received attention from its early days in the 1990’s because American Single Malt was a novelty. In 2000, Gary Regan and Mardee Haidin Ragen noted in the Malt Advocate (March, 2000, p. 24) that in the world of American whiskey, “the times they are a-changing.” Their article described how single malts have started to gain in popularity over the past decade and “full flavored American whiskey has made a comeback.” At that time (2000) three artisanal distillers were making American Single Malts, but only McCarthy’s had been released.    McCarthy’s started to receive significant acclaim in 2004, when Jim Murray’s Whiskey Bible gave McCarthy’s its Best Small Batch Whiskey in the world award and a score of 94. That same year Michael Jackson put McCarthy’s in his list of The Ten Best American Whiskeys, published in both the Men’s Journal (December 2004) and The Malt Advocate ( First Quarter 2005). Consistently rave reviews have continued. In his 2006 edition of The Whiskey Bible, Jim Murray wrote, “McCarthy’s has earned a place among the world’s elite whiskeys.” His 2008 edition of The Whiskey Bible gave McCarthy’s a phenomenal score of 96."

Sweet and spicy in the taste with mint, lemon zest, roses, pepper, citrus, macaroons and alcohol warmth — soft and nice. A light to medium body. Finishes with spices, vanilla, black pepper, flowers and alcohol warmth. Although Poitín is traditionally consumed straight, the warm and toasty flavors make a compelling cocktail as well.

It’s a San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Gold Medal winner that pushes boundaries and redefines how bourbons are created while remaining true to the core of the bourbon’s principles. 

It’s a collaboration as distinct as the two whiskey legends who made it. Fred Noe from the founding family of bourbon and Jim Beam’s seventh-generation Master Distiller and Shinji Fukuyo from the founding house of Japanese whisky and Suntory’s fifth-ever Chief Blender. 

Together they created a blend of several unique bourbons aged in newly charred white oak barrels and some extra-aged in wine and sherry casks. The result is a rounded and balanced bourbon that is layered, complex and unlike anything you’ve ever tried."

Rich and yet unpretentious, there's nothing quite like Noah's Mill Bourbon. Part of the Willett Family of Bourbons, Noah's Mill is distilled in Bardstown, Kentucky, which is often referred to as the ""Bourbon Capital of the World."" That's why there's no surprise that Noah's Mill is one of the leading craft bourbons on the market.

Aged for anywhere from 4 years to 20 years, Noah's Mill is only made in small batches, assuring that it's made with the care and diligence that only a craft bourbon can achieve. Once you uncork this bad boy, you're overwhelmed with floral, prune and walnut aromas. Each drink of this bourbon is lush with flavors of spice, lavender and caramel that make it a unique mix that only comes with a bottle of Noah's Mill Bourbon.

Like any top-shelf bourbon, you don't want to sully the flavors with any mixers unless you're a non-traditionalist. Most drinkers will find the bourbon best with a few fingers in a low-ball glass, while a splash of water or an ice cube adds a cool rush to the beverage, especially if you're enjoying it outdoors.

If you're a cocktail drinker, Noah's Mill Bourbon is the perfect choice to take your drink to new heights. From an Old Fashioned to a mint julep, it turns everything it touches into the best drink you've never had.

Nor'Easter Bourbon ""” named for these legendary storms that have battered New England ""” is made from a mash of 60% corn, 35% barley and 5% rye.

""Our climate and geography have a real noticeable impact on the taste of the bourbon,"" says Harman. The distillery's proximity to the ocean and marine haze (Nantucket is nicknamed ""The Grey Lady"") add a touch of salt to the bourbon. The hints of salt are complimented by notes of mild vanilla, sweet corn and a touch of honey, which precede a medium-long, smooth finish.

The advantages of wooden barrels were evident - not only were they less fragile than clay vessels, but their cylindrical shape allowed them to be rolled rather than carried across short distances. As settlers along the Nile quickly realized, however, barrels made from wooden staves imparted a unique color and flavor profile to the liquids stored within.    Buck 8 Year Old Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey is matured for a minimum of eight years in new American oak casks under the intense Kentucky sun. As a result of this maturation process, the bourbon has a caramel color, along with an aroma of vanilla, dark fruits, creme brÃ»lée and honey. The aroma gives way to notes of cherries, maple syrup, waffle cones and wood spices on the palate, and leads to a finish accented by touches of caramel, charcoal and cocoa.

Craig would eventually move west to Kentucky, leaving a legacy of bourbon whiskey in the Old Dominion. Several years later, in 1797, President George Washington would profit from a distilling operation at his Mount Vernon Farm. The Bowmans began producing bourbon at the end of Prohibition and the fabled Virginia Gentleman became the region's drink of choice for decades.    The award-winning VG90 Small Batch Bourbon combines a unique copper still and multi-layered filtration system with aging of at least six years in new oak charred barrels.

The Finger Lakes region is also home to quite a few small farms, from which they get their corn, rye, barley, and the other grains and fruits that they use to make their premium spirits. Finger Lakes Distilling is a NYS Farm Distillery, which means that they're a small operation making a handcrafted product. It also means they're able to devote all their attention to everything they make; they don't take any shortcuts. Their flavored vodkas and liqueurs are made in the traditional manner, by soaking real fruits in the spirit. They don't add extracts or synthetic flavoring to speed up the process. Their whiskies rest in oak barrels for as long as they need to, until they mature into the rich aged spirit that they offer with pride. This is their first cask strength single barrel to make it out to CA and a wheated bourbon at that. Big bold and full of character, this is definitely their most intriguing product and pretty solid effort from this little upstart. This is bourbon's mashbill is 70%, 20% wheat, and 10% malt.

Monkey Shoulder casks are former bourbon casks, which add smooth vanilla flavors to this Scotch. It also has no grain whisky whatsoever anywhere in or even near the drink. It's barley all the way, folks.

The name Monkey Shoulder might sound funny, but it has a history in whisky making. The maltmen who used to turn the barley would take long shifts, using their dominant arm significantly while working. At the end, their shoulders would droop on one side, an ailment that became known as ""Monkey Shoulder."" Today, nobody working at Monkey Shoulder actually has the affliction, though the barley still gets turned by hand. Working conditions are much better than they used to be. The name sounds cool and harkens back to the old whisky making days.

Monkey Shoulder tastes delicious neat, with a splash of water, and on the rocks. It stands out in mixed drinks, too, given its orange and vanilla flavors with a bit of spice. Try it in a Rob Roy or a Blood and Sand to impress your palate and your friends.

He and his brother General John Munro were notable as being benign and caring landlords in a region which was brutally hit by the Highland Clearances. 

Another local man, John Ross, took the lease in 1869 and ran the site until 1895 when it was transferred to Elgin-based blenders Munro & Cameron. It was the trustees of the late Innes Cameron who sold Teaninich to DCL in 1933.

It has undergone regular expansion – larger stills were installed in 1946, before the pair were doubled in 1962. In 1970 a new distillery, Teaninch ‘A Side’, with six stills was built. The two parts ran simultaneously until 1984, when the original site (‘B Side’) was silenced.

The same thing is about to happen all over again. Teaninich’s capacity is due to double to 9m litres per annum and there are plans to build a separate 10m litres per annum distillery on the same site.

The use of the technology, which removes the need for a mash tun, was to produce ultra-clear wort, giving a clue as to the Teaninich distillery character: a fragrant exotic grassiness that brings to mind Japanese green tea and coumarin-rich bison grass. Fat stills also add a distinct oiliness to the texture while not blunting any of its penetrating acidity."

A cereal taste like nutty granola coated in ginger syrup and a delicate astringency from the cask maturation provides depth and balance.

Gentle peat smoke makes its presence known by turning up the volume on the spicy flavours whilst adding a punchy and peppery finish."
